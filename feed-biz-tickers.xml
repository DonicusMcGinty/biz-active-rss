Users can send and receive XMR globally without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain; the TX history of all XMR users is kept hidden, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic block size that can &amp;quot;stretch&amp;quot; to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR&amp;#x27;s mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR&amp;#x27;s tail emission - 0.6 XMR per block forever - incentivizes for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation trends to zero and is offset by coin loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR has proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC&amp;#x27;s network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. XMR is also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you still have questions, feel free to ask. A MoneroChad will be with you shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR Redpill: https://youtube.com/watch?v=wq6w03E2DS4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUY XMR: https://monero.eco/exchanges/&lt;br&gt;Crypto ATMs: https://coinatmradar.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR Resources: https://monero.observer/resources/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR Stats: https://moneroj.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USE XMR: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OFFICIAL WEBSITE: https://getmonero.org&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MINING: &lt;br&gt;https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/mining/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WALLETS:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Desktop&lt;br&gt;Official GUI/CLI wallet&lt;br&gt;Featherwallet&lt;br&gt;Stack Wallet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Mobile&lt;br&gt;Cake Wallet&lt;br&gt;Monero.com&lt;br&gt;Stack Wallet&lt;br&gt;Unstoppable &lt;br&gt;Monerujo (Android)&lt;br&gt;Monfluo (Android)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Infodumps&lt;br&gt;https://rentry.org/monero-explained&lt;br&gt;https://moneroinfodump.neocities.org &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61761870&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Replies (oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61848809&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847794&lt;br&gt;You were already given the a TLDR so you don&amp;#x27;t have to read through the chat logs like I and many other anons have&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61839127&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The TLDR is that this particular doomer porn fantasy can&amp;#x27;t compromise anyone&amp;#x27;s privacy.&lt;br&gt;At what point will you accept this answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61848827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should look for ways to improve Monero&amp;#x27;s (official) material and appearance, not to induce any kind of pump, but to effectively convey the principles and message of why Monero, specifically out of other privacy coins, is extremely unique in the freedom it provides in contrast to all other money systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now it seems like very old material, links and screencaps keeps getting recycled. There&amp;#x27;s so many recent world events happening that tie in to Monero&amp;#x27;s use and we&amp;#x27;re missing a translation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monerochan (mostly AI slop) also doesn&amp;#x27;t communicate anything about Monero&lt;br&gt;There doesn&amp;#x27;t seem to be any good image macros to share from these threads&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interested in how other people view this issue and what kind of material would get the communication standard up to the same level as its founding principles and tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849019&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848053&lt;br&gt;Thanks anon. No cap fr fr Tbh I had no idea it was there before it was pointed out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849231&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847794&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847814&lt;br&gt;They will never provide you an answer anon. Monerocucks are glowniggers, pretending to not be. Its funny watching them recoil in fear though. Just look at the past few generals, they cant even BTFO nerva jeets lmfao... look here&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61831334&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847825&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;why cant they just tell reddit why its safe?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;doesnt and cant&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cant even tell 4channers in a simple format&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Well *I* asked *you* that one for a reason.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Please tell me what explicit attack scenario exists in which the five dollar wrench and current KYC measurements are infeasible but having to give out your view keys is.&lt;br&gt;the taxman who says &amp;quot;gib?&amp;quot; Normies fold faster than a wet noodle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848809&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You were already given the a TLDR&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;At what point will you accept this answer?&lt;br&gt;cant even get a copy and paste job on here&lt;br&gt;oh...&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;1pbtid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You all sound like pathetic freemasons who suck jew dick.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;wErE nOt BaD pPl!? oH bUt YoU hAvE tO jOiN uS tO fInD OuT wHaT wE BeLiEvE iN!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;kills you when you defect or tell a secret after finding out they worship the satan&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;lmao moneroniggers and their copium at their finest. Go glow on some other basket weaving forum. Is it any wonder XMR generals never get banned for advertisement? Its because 4chan is backdoored with JDIF, and JDIF &amp;amp; Monero suck each others dicks. One big blowjob circlejerk for their father satan.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;inb4 some cuck even tries to reply to me, you cant even keep up with my precision and speed. anyone who reads this knows im right. i use your shill threads to spread truth, and there is nothing you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849859&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848827&lt;br&gt;I feel like most of the older stuff is still applicable since it&amp;#x27;s just about the basics. See picrel as an example. However I agree that the more specific guides (for example how and where to get XMR) rarely has good pictures. Do you have other bad examples so we can make a list? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;cant even tell 4channers in a simple format&lt;br&gt;Five sentences isn&amp;#x27;t hard if you ask me. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the taxman who says &amp;quot;gib?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;1. You already need to be deanonymized for that. The ways you can get deanonymized will stay the same. This would also be combated by using an exchange wallet. I&amp;#x27;d probably even use an on-ramp wallet, an off-ramp wallet and a holding wallet. This way even if you were deanonymized and the IRS asks for more than what they&amp;#x27;re allowed to ask (just the income as a number, not the sources or which bank account it went to) you&amp;#x27;d still retain your privacy. &lt;br&gt;2. This is already possible by being coerced through various means. A view key won&amp;#x27;t change that. This is proven by your next sentence. &amp;gt;Normies fold faster than a wet noodle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short: All proposed &amp;#x27;new&amp;#x27; attack vectors already exist, require additional information that isn&amp;#x27;t easily obtained (they tried for years and still couldn&amp;#x27;t get it) and are easily mitigated. &lt;br&gt;Additionally, if someone for whatever reason was willing to inform the IRS of the relevant taxes by directly allowing access to view the wallet (which still is absurd and not how it works) it&amp;#x27;d be much easier and also less risky. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have any other scenarios in which view keys could be exploited which are not covered already please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850085&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re clearly retarded and can&amp;#x27;t follow a conversation, so I&amp;#x27;ll highlight the points for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I gave the answer to the view key FUD here&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61838278&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which sent anon into a tizzy that didn&amp;#x27;t actually refute anything I posted, here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61838817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;whos doomer porn fantasy? XMRfags cant even keep an eye on whos talking to who in here. I dont care about nerva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which I then edited to ease his butthurt here&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61839127&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The TLDR is that this particular doomer porn fantasy can&amp;#x27;t compromise anyone&amp;#x27;s privacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he wanted an official statement from the devs to ease his butthurt &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847581&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I gave him that too &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847618&lt;br&gt;Which sent anon into another tizzy, because he seems to agree with some redditor that &amp;quot;it&amp;#x27;s just toooooo hard to read the documentation! Why can&amp;#x27;t they spoonfeed me!?&amp;quot; Here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847794&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;why should i trust monero at all&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;picrelated from reddit thread. why cant they just tell reddit why its safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To which I then pounted out that he was already given the spoonfed answer that doesn&amp;#x27;t require him to read anything on github or librera &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848809&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then asked the same question I&amp;#x27;ll ask you now:&lt;br&gt;At what point will you accept this answer? Seriously, what don&amp;#x27;t you faggots get?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850591&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848021&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been waiting for a few hours now. Due to your lack of questions I assume you are agreeing with me that carrot does not pose a privacy threat. I&amp;#x27;m glad we could finally come to an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851129&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849859&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850085&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850591&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been waiting for a few hours now. Due to your lack of questions I assume you are agreeing with me that carrot does not pose a privacy threat&lt;br&gt;There is a good chance he&amp;#x27;s banned. For some reason, criticizing your shitcoin (Monero) is against jannie law. I was banned recently for criticizing it. Look at the nerva faggots. They keep being banned as well. What doesnt puzzle anyone is how your general stays up for days without deletion, yet the only organic traction your threads have are from posters who get banned criticizing you. Its because youre a bunch of glowniggers who work for (((the island bunch))) and have this site backdoored. If competition shows up, the thread gets shadow banned and falls off the catalog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Youll never answer the questions regarding the upcoming fork and always link their github page because YOU dont understand it. Face the truth, the reason the reddit comments dont get answered is because NO ONE understands it. The reason the even more damning questions get deleted is because theyre asking the right questions. For some reason, Monero thinks its better to implement something that is unnecessary rather than something that should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;In short: All proposed &amp;#x27;new&amp;#x27; attack vectors already exist&lt;br&gt;Take a good hard look at that statement youre defending&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Which sent anon into a tizzy that didn&amp;#x27;t actually refute anything I posted&lt;br&gt;Maybe its because you all brought up the &amp;quot;doomer fantasy&amp;quot;? He never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your wins are not the wins you think they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;At what point will you accept this answer? Seriously, what don&amp;#x27;t you faggots get?&lt;br&gt;Since youll never post an answer to the questions, Why should they repeat themselves? Its an XMR thread, not the audience&amp;#x27;s thread. You have to provide an adequate answer and are up for scrutiny, not them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851235&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;For some reason, criticizing your shitcoin (Monero) is against jannie law.&lt;br&gt;No, you retards get banned for shilling for nerva. Also it&amp;#x27;s weird to assume he got banned after his 14th post over 3 days meanwhile you&amp;#x27;ve also posted fud over the days and still are present. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They keep being banned as well.&lt;br&gt;Who knows, maybe it&amp;#x27;s the constant shilling and the spam they don&amp;#x27;t just post here but on the board itself through a variety of threads. Btw when you don&amp;#x27;t get banned your generals just hit page 10 and die. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;What doesnt puzzle anyone is how your general stays up for days without deletion,&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s because the XMR general is fairly active and removing established generals would just lead to more shitposting. I hope you don&amp;#x27;t want the 10 millionth LINK thread this year.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;yet the only organic traction your threads have are from posters who get banned criticizing you.&lt;br&gt;Did you forget the moonfags that tried to take over this general, the qubic fud, the view key fud and the zioncash shills? All of those happened less than 6 months ago. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and have this site backdoored.&lt;br&gt;No need for a backdoor when the mods are jews and feds. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;If competition shows up, the thread gets shadow banned and falls off the catalog.&lt;br&gt;Really? What happened to &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61841738 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61827591 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61822264 and &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61809799? Those are just some of the ones you had and that died because your community consists entirely of a few jeets and baggies. Graciously I sometimes enter your threads and ask you simple questions which you can&amp;#x27;t answer despite their simplicity. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youll never answer the questions regarding the upcoming fork&lt;br&gt;I did a few hours ago and now I&amp;#x27;m waiting for more questions. Let me know if you have some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;always link their github page because&lt;br&gt;Me? No I didn&amp;#x27;t. I know github is something that challenges the nerva jeet heavily so instead I break it down in very simple terms. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;because YOU dont understand it.&lt;br&gt;Your questions? You don&amp;#x27;t seem to have any.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the reason the reddit comments dont get answered is because NO ONE understands it.&lt;br&gt;I already answered all of the questions I saw. If you have more let me know. The assumption that no one understand cryptography or psychology is absurd considering the existence of that field. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The reason the even more damning questions get deleted is because theyre asking the right questions.&lt;br&gt;Like what? So far each question I saw I answered on here. I don&amp;#x27;t use reddit but feel free to keep me updated on orange site. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;For some reason, Monero thinks its better to implement something that is unnecessary&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;ve already been told that view keys will have some benefits. I recall hardware wallet and merchant software support being named in this thread. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rather than something that should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;Devs, due to being part of a community and mostly unpaid, decide what they wish to implement. If it&amp;#x27;s fcmp++ they&amp;#x27;ll work on fcmp++, if it&amp;#x27;s carrot, they&amp;#x27;ll work on carrot. You can&amp;#x27;t force strangers that donate their time to do only what you want them to do especially if it&amp;#x27;s a feature you can easily avoid. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Take a good hard look at that statement youre defending&lt;br&gt;That literally nothing will worsen with carrot? Seems like a fine statement to me. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Since youll never post an answer to the questions,&lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t speak for anon but I already answered every question you have. If you have any other questions let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851255&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;In return I&amp;#x27;d like to ask you a few questions: &lt;br&gt;1. How do you ensure unmaintained software keeps up with the security demands it has?&lt;br&gt;2. How do you ensure that no one attacks nerva by locally clustering CPUs? &lt;br&gt;3. Why do your devs believe Discord to be a development platform despite being on github? &lt;br&gt;4. How do you ensure the safety of your devs in case of an attack by glowies if they all use the ID-requiring discord and 40% of them (50% of your lead devs) having doxxed themselves publicly?&lt;br&gt;5. What other questions do you have for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851332&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851235&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;No, you retards get banned for shilling for nerva. Also it&amp;#x27;s weird to assume he got banned after his 14th post over 3 days meanwhile you&amp;#x27;ve also posted fud over the days and still are present. &lt;br&gt;Ive posted twice you jeetbot, (3 times now) and none of it was about nerva. Ill disregard the rest of this botpost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851245&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Your questions? You don&amp;#x27;t seem to have any.&lt;br&gt;Never did, go back and reread my posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851255&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;xmrbotpost about nerva. &lt;br&gt;Never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Glownero&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851379&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851332&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Ive posted twice&lt;br&gt;Correct, I was speaking about rVCB8pdb, I assume you were doing that too or do you speak about yourself in the third person? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and none of it was about nerva.&lt;br&gt;Good job not having and reading comprehension and forgetting you posted: &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;they cant even BTFO nerva jeets lmfao (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231)&lt;br&gt;and: &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I was banned recently for criticizing it. Look at the nerva faggots. (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851332&lt;br&gt;You combined any criticism against XMR with nerva. So by your own logic most of the criticism here comes from the nervajeets.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Never did,&lt;br&gt;If you don&amp;#x27;t have any questions, then why do you keep pestering me about needing to answer them? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;All three of your posts mentioned nerva in a positive light.&lt;br&gt;Feel free to answer any of my questions (see &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851255 for the easiest ones) or give me any of the question which you apparently don&amp;#x27;t have but are lamenting as being unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youll never answer the questions regarding the upcoming fork and always link their github page because YOU dont understand it.&lt;br&gt;I link the github because I like having a source to back up my claims, and I actually want you to stop being a faggot and refute them&lt;br&gt;No, accusations of being a fedfreemasonbot out to get you are not refutations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;For some reason, Monero thinks its better to implement something that is unnecessary rather than something that should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;Who exactly are you to decide whether or not a feature is unnecessary and shouldn&amp;#x27;t be implemented?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Maybe its because you all brought up the &amp;quot;doomer fantasy&amp;quot;? He never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;Given how he was asking about them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61838139&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;so when someone says kyc will ask for this and then the feds will use it for surveillance, theyre correct? then it&amp;#x27;s not FUD&lt;br&gt;I hit the fast forward button on his line of thought since he clearly believes that view keys present some sort of threat, and I didn&amp;#x27;t feel like waiting 10 posts for him to go &amp;quot;WELL IF THEY GET ENOUGH TO VIEW KEYS IT&amp;#x27;LL BE THE END OF PRIVACY!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;If this was wrong of me, then my bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Your wins are not the wins you think they are.&lt;br&gt;Who said I was trying to win anything? Why are you perpetuating this weird fantasy? You&amp;#x27;re weird bro. Not a good look at all, man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851879&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been out of it for a while, how do I buy some and use it to acquire ketamine? Last time I was doing this, we used bitcoin and it was $220.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852742&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851879&lt;br&gt;Send any major crypto to Trocador. Swap to XMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852911&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851879&lt;br&gt;What this guy said&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852742&lt;br&gt;Then visit Dread dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad onion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853405&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851879&lt;br&gt;Get any other coin and swap for Monero on Trocador.&lt;br&gt;Have the monero sent to your cake wallet.&lt;br&gt;Go on Dread to find what&amp;#x27;s the current best darknet market.&lt;br&gt;Go on the DNM and buy your product with Monero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the steps take a bit of time but it&amp;#x27;s not complicated. Once you know how everything works it&amp;#x27;s no more complex than an Amazon order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854237&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61810651&lt;br&gt;Bloomberg published an article on Monero this morning. It’s behind a paywall but here is the article thanks to some Twitter anon.&lt;br&gt;https://pastebin.com/6aqniwe1&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;As digital assets go mainstream and law enforcement agencies get more adept at seizing illicit crypto, “privacy coins” like Monero hark back to the industry’s foundational idea: the creation of a decentralized electronic cash system running outside the purview of governments and central banks. That’s given them a cult following among libertarian-leaning crypto users — while providing a handy tool for criminals.&lt;br&gt;The rest of the article is just (((Bloomberg))) seething about how it can’t be tracked and a mention of the upcoming hard fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854655&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854237&lt;br&gt;They really seemed to think the view key fud would be more effective if they now need to publish paid articles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855033&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61696670&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;suggest wallet that can store XRP,XMR,USDT and Zcash is there any&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out this actually does exist. Hope this anon is still lurking &lt;br&gt;https://edge.app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855123&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I need to send someone 5$ for a beer while anonymous. Thing is I have no fucking clue how any of this cryptocurrency works. Can someone explain to me same way you would to a retard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855365&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855123&lt;br&gt;Yeah, follow the chat here: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61817263&lt;br&gt;If you have any issue or problem at a specific step ask here and we&amp;#x27;ll help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy the &amp;quot;beer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855558&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855365&lt;br&gt;Ok, installed the cake wallet program, made the wallet, both monero and litecoin. Now I need to actually buy the crypto so I can transfer it to the wallet I just made. I think I still have an old paypal account which apparently allows you to buy crypto now. Is that ok for me to buy litecoin, transfer it to the cake wallet and exchange it for monero or will I be de-anonymized for using paypal just this once?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855558&lt;br&gt;Once it gets to your wallet it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855579&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855558&lt;br&gt;I never bought crypto with PayPal but if you can buy LTC, do it. Once you swap to Monero and have it in your personal wallet you become invisible and cannot be deanonymized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856711&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854237&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854655&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Jewish media bashing monero&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Just like they did with Trump&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Sub Artic IQs dont notice theyre promoting it on purpose&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Paid promoters ITT walk around the fact that concern was brought up by actual users and went unanswered or were outright removed posts/threads, then claim the view key fud was started by the very mossad theyre unironically supporting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Glowner, promoted by Glews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856863&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856711&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Monero General&amp;quot; thread&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CTRL + F &amp;quot;nerva&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;140 results&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your unmaintained shitcoin will NEVER be relevant you poojeet retards.

Some riddle of a hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857169&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guys, schizo chicken lady here, recovering from a week of waging after my xrp stack never mooned. Honestly I think we&amp;#x27;re deluded thinking xrp is going to moon at all. There are only 1000 active accounts and 50k daily transactions on the xrp ledger. I think any price pumps were due to ripple marketing. Sorry. I sold 25% of my xrp this week for Tron. There&amp;#x27;s zero hype about Tron in news or gematria. In fact i can&amp;#x27;t find any secondary information about it. But it has 850m daily transactions and has outperformed xrp since inception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857211&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meme is that xrp will moon when it finds utility. But the ledger has been around for 14 years and no one is using it, mo natter how many riddles, acquisitions, or tweets ripple spits out. The ledger just seems like an clunky ibm project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857230&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857211&lt;br&gt;Then why is it that every time we break out and start to climb they dump the whole market to suppress us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857238&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857230&lt;br&gt;The chart the last six months just looks like a steady decline, not a surpresssed breakout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857247&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857169&lt;br&gt;CHICKEN TRANNY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857238&lt;br&gt;Yeah except last night we were chartmogging BTC by pumpmaxing to 1.66 out of nowhere and the Epstein client list got mad and pissed their pants and dumped the market to bring us back into line by dragging us down with them.

All you need to do is more than you do now. So I guess 2 sets is plenty. The hardest part is starting and you&amp;#x27;ve created s gigacope excuse that you cannot get your fat ass on the floor doing push ups until you own a ranch. Unless you weight 17 tonnes and need a barn to lay down, I think you&amp;#x27;re being a faggot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855461&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855377&lt;br&gt;There is a reason he made all that money snd you didn&amp;#x27;t. It&amp;#x27;s the same reason he will again while you do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855465&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah well 10k sure would make me a lot more happy than I am now, my friend died this morning, plus I&amp;#x27;m broke and it&amp;#x27;s raining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855473&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855461&lt;br&gt;you know nothing about me faggot. he&amp;#x27;ll never see 4 million again in his life I guarantee it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855484&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s interesting how some people look like they just aren&amp;#x27;t meant to be dancers&lt;br&gt;bless that dude for trying though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;I an incel who only ever banged 7 hookers (thank god no STDs) but having 10 million would very much better my life. I don’t care if I still can’t get a gf, at very least I can be comfy and take care of my parents and help my nephews and nieces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also if I really wanted to I could just be upfront with a bitch and make an arrangement where she gives me kids and I provide for her if I wanted children of my own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;Money definitely buys happiness when I was rich I had a great diet and workout regimen now that I am back to wage cucking I am a alcoholic cocaine addict&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855547&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;Fuck he&amp;#x27;s good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855550&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;you just KNOW this girl fell for the dancing chud&lt;br&gt;look at her face and how much she is smiling by grinding herself all over him&lt;br&gt;this chud did the impossible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855561&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;White rizzler goated with the sauce while shanequa thirsts for that bwc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855727&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;QUIRKED UP WHITE BOY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SWAGGER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855728&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;Try buying food with happiness, retard.&lt;br&gt;You sound like a retarded cunt, who everyone else is talking care of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855740&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;Money might not buy happiness. But it ends unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855746&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;get back in the fucking cage, wagie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855754&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s true. Sometimes I get down about work and money. But at the end of the day I have a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and a girl who loves me and sucks my dick on command. Just having those three things makes me a rich man. Happiness is a mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855775&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My father just died one year after he retired from ALS. He was extremely jewish with his money, and never did anything fun. Now my mom has it all. You need to cultivate something along the way. Everyone thinks they will live to at least 80 even though that probably won&amp;#x27;t be the case. Don&amp;#x27;t waste your life waiting for the moment you are imagining will turn it all around. It might pass you by forever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855784&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855775&lt;br&gt;ngmi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855799&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855775&lt;br&gt;ngmi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855561&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That nigger bitch is vile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856107&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;but with a nice pc and a comfortable chair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856663&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t care about being a extra virgin incel, all I care about is escaping the hell that is wageslaving. Let me read books and play video games and go for long walks and the rest of the world can fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856683&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855356&lt;br&gt;7 figures to 5 is rough. I&amp;#x27;ve done 7 to 6 to various extent multiple times and am back to 6 now again, thought I was in multiple 7s a few months ago. I just feel there&amp;#x27;s more to come but of course knowing what I know now, I have regrets. But investing in retrospect is the easiest thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856924&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855804&lt;br&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t have to repeat the same thing twice in one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856941&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Laughs in going to a country with a debased and devalued currency&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856948&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When you make it you&amp;#x27;re still gonna be a virgin incel.&lt;br&gt;Correct, and I&amp;#x27;m happy with that&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The only difference is you&amp;#x27;ll have $10 million in the bank that you won&amp;#x27;t even spend since your only hobbies are 4chud and pirating PC games.&lt;br&gt;Correct, but I won&amp;#x27;t have to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t get it, are you trying to demoralize or lift me up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857249&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855335&lt;br&gt;If I had 10 million I would spend all day fucking s tier hookers. I would have sugar babies. I would go to Japan and use brothels like hotels. I would have cute barely legal twinks on my dick 24/7 dressed in their school uniforms. Why the fuck would I be a virgin incel. Money buys everything.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;hurrrrrrrrr but no affection not real love hurrrrrrrrrrr&lt;br&gt;Ok? I don&amp;#x27;t care. Who is happier, the wageslave brokie with a gf or a multi-millionaire on a yaht? If you think it&amp;#x27;s the wageslave, it&amp;#x27;s because you&amp;#x27;re retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857275&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857249&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;a multi-millionaire on a yaht&lt;br&gt;you mean a yak ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857310&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;dire you can buy a woman but whaf abouf her feelings&lt;br&gt;What a cuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771112101370155s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>[ATOM] Thread 61857081 — 1 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61857081</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61857081?lm=1771175786</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:16:26 +0000</pubDate><description>Open article for full thread</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;[ATOM] Thread 61857081&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61857081'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 1 • Updated: 2026-02-15 17:16 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I put a couple thousands on crypto some time ago, just to see what happens, didn&amp;#x27;t go well (I&amp;#x27;m not a trader), was able to soften the blow through by staking on ATOM but I&amp;#x27;m tired of holding.&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#x27;s a good exit plan?

Concern trolls want to Crypost but their caustic concerns completely crumble by the confirmation of the CUSIP Confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854722&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854641&lt;br&gt;there is also a conundrum concerning a certain creditor to the company :o)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854941&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854722&lt;br&gt;Checked. Who could it be? What does it all mean?!?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont care.&lt;br&gt;I dont cafè&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003&lt;br&gt;This goes to show you just how dumb and disingenuous the silly shillies are. You can ask Goldberg whatever the hell you want but he is not obligated to give you a truthful answer when M&amp;amp;A is involved. He wouldn&amp;#x27;t tell you so this is completely useless. &lt;br&gt;This still does not solve the CUSIP Conundrum. Words only get you so far, but right here right now in 2026 there are open Bed Bath and Beyond stores and the company that operates them is not even using the Overstock/BYON/BBBY CUSIP. They issued new securities in October using BBBYQs CUSIP. &lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s already proven 100% fact that a reverse merger of the BBBYQ shell has already occurred with BBBY. There is zero counterargument. &lt;br&gt;Overstock, BYON and BBBY all kept them same CUSIP. So why now does it suddenly switch? Occams Razor solves the puzzle: BBBYQ shell reverse merger has already occured and the details are not in any known docket.&lt;br&gt;BBBY mystery has been solved by yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855551&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003&lt;br&gt;Mayhaps DK-Butterfly and DK-Butterfly1 are different entities. As per the Jake DD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855610&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855551&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s just a typo, bro. For some reason, when writing out DK-Butterfly. I, too, will accidentally add on a -1 for no reason. This speculative theories are bizarre-1. See! Haha, I did it on accident just now. I can&amp;#x27;t even believe I did that LOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855697&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856432&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855697&lt;br&gt;I dont care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hallo?&lt;br&gt;When BBBY return? &lt;br&gt;I dont care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857266&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857014&lt;br&gt;BBBY is trading now. BBBYQ was canceled, and no longer exists. If you had BBBYQ when it was canceled you lost that investment, it can never be returned.

The industrial sector has been mooning ever since the Liberation Day tariffs kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853805&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;let it go, lover her for different aspects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853825&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;tell her to stop being dumb, then explain again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;direct deposit her paycheck into your account and give her an allowance like she&amp;#x27;s a mentally retarded niggerbaby incapable of managing her own money (because she is.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853925&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;She&amp;#x27;s the bread winner isn&amp;#x27;t she? Tell her about the Comex shortage. Too late to stack physical silver. But early enough to do mining stocks. Get her a solid silver bracelet then do the minning stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853939&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s every woman. My wife spends her entire paycheck on bills and groceries and buying clothes and shit for her and the kids. Shift all the household expenses onto your wife so you can wisely manage the family wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;Tell her to invest in gold jewelry first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pull up sp500 10 year&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pull up fed brrrrrr chart, m2 then m4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if you can&amp;#x27;t convince her you find a new wife. lack of learn term thinking is not acceptable in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853987&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You act like a man and tell her what you&amp;#x27;re going to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854097&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;Manage it for her. She won&amp;#x27;t miss the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854115&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853720&lt;br&gt;What are some good industrial stocks to invest in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854144&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;niggers is trying to discuss investing with a woman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854198&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853986&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s stupid. Just rape her and tell her what to do with her money like you&amp;#x27;re her husband instead of her cuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854200&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;my wife&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;she manages her own finances&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s your problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854203&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854198&lt;br&gt;How’s the weather in Mumbai?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854213&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854144&lt;br&gt;I am a woman. Most are low risk investors. OP really screwed up. Should have told her 2-5 years ago to buy 100 oz of silver and an ounce of gold. Worst case scenario it will be a slightly lower price if there is an emergency expense when the price is down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854221&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854213&lt;br&gt;post tits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854232&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853720&lt;br&gt;That sounds wonderful, but I can&amp;#x27;t seem to find an industrials-only ETF or mutual fund that would let me participate. Anybody want to recommend one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854234&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;Why would your wife have any say over finances?&lt;br&gt;Get her preggers and put her to work in the kitchen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854373&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854232&lt;br&gt;Google &amp;quot;DJIA index fund&amp;quot; and take your pick, or if that&amp;#x27;s too much work then &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust, ticker DIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854387&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854198&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854203&lt;br&gt;You can’t rape your wife dude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854492&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;Women are fucking idiots and should be enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855768&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Divorce her now. The marriage won&amp;#x27;t work long term, and if you have kids you&amp;#x27;ll lose them, too. This marriage was probably the worse decision you have ever made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855836&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;buy a home? it&amp;#x27;s okay to have cash in the bank if you have lots of USD debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855863&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;people spend years on 4chins, learn nothing, and end up marrying the exact kind of dumb bitch multiple boards warned about &lt;br&gt;You deserve each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857234&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853689&lt;br&gt;if you&amp;#x27;re so smart, why aren&amp;#x27;t you rich (and so don&amp;#x27;t care about your wife&amp;#x27;s money)&lt;br&gt;turns out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure you can make a million if you dca and invest s thousand s month for 30 years. But in 30 years that&amp;#x27;d be worth 1000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771078808688287s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item></channel></rss>
