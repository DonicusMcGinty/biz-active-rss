Link came within a hair of flipping xrp in January ‘21. We all know that Link is everything Xrp fraudulently claims to be so it makes sense that this chart should flip soon enough. Will it be gradual or violent? Will it flip because xrp crashes or because Link moons? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly where are some places you can use Link as collateral to borrow Xrp to take full advantage of the trade of the century?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889606&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m so tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889622&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;Link is scam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy XRP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891035&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;Thanks spammy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891011&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not. It is literally the products they are building and the material they are releasing detailing it to shareholders. Link sell directly to retail every time there is a minor pump. You are literally saying nothing but standing in a way where you think if you come across as affirmative in a direct way it will seem like you are. Lol You are just doing what you accuse me of (which I am not) saying we can&amp;#x27;t trust it to be true because it is relying on the words of someone. It literally isn&amp;#x27;t. They are structuring XRPL core amendment pushes and having their staff code them based on the product suite fit detailed in the article. They made multiple multibillion dollar acquisitions, including a fucking prime broker to actuate it all. And most importantly, the majority of their treasury is in XRP and their products are ALL made more efficient and cost efficient using it and they are incentivized to increase the price of XRP they have in escrow and cannot sell, unlike CLL who dump what was supposed to be operator rewards on retail always and are LITERALLY a fraud designed to milk your savings (exactly what you project Ripple to be, which it isn&amp;#x27;t because the XRPL actually solves efficiencies instead of sticking a tollbooth in the middle of process for literally no reason like a jewish parasite). The entire XRPL is designed to automatically use XRP for auto-bridging between assets etc. Your argument sucks and it is hilarious that it actually applies to link, which you are capable of seeing but literally don&amp;#x27;t care because you are in a literal cult pretending to object but just obsessively committed to a project that is the least morally redeemable or utility having one in all of crypto for literally no reason than ego and entrenched specific coin cultism. Really odd and gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890083&lt;br&gt;Extreme cope. SWIFT said it would take 15 years MINIMUM to even get a product active. I am not sorry to let you know that by that time SWIFT will have 100% missed the boat and payments will have been completely revolutionized, not needing them. You hitched your dingy to a big ship, but it turned out it was the Titanic, which we all always said. Way too little way too late presuming the ethgate lawfare would win but it didn&amp;#x27;t. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890250&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;MPT/permissioned dex is the standard&lt;br&gt;No it hasn&amp;#x27;t. You literally don&amp;#x27;t know what either of those things are. No other ledger at scale has a built in dex and amm and protocol layer compliance like permissioned dex nor the broadness of the MPT standard. It definitely has been The Standard, but not in the way you think. MPT is not &amp;quot;wrapped assets.&amp;quot; Here is an AI slop video that is actually informative which possibly someone at your level of research will be able to be spoonfed by:&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/3kYXW_o-N4Y&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890519&lt;br&gt;Top cope in thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890891&lt;br&gt;Everything written proves it&amp;#x27;s a security anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890307&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890390&lt;br&gt;The only thing that needs to happen to settle the debate is someone suing. And given chainlink seemingly gives zero fucks about it&amp;#x27;s holders it&amp;#x27;s probably long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891887&lt;br&gt;It has an etf already bro it’s a defacto commodity and will soon be enshrined in law as a commodity. Also may I just congratulate you on your point that ripple is incentivised to increase the price of Xrp since that is most of their treasury, unlike CLL who also has most of their treasury in Link but is not incentivised to increase the price. I thought that was most salient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892122&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;Dunno man, but the best times with link have been when I forgot about it during the bear and came back to big gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892185&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891717&lt;br&gt;So other than the CEOs word, what proof do you have they&amp;#x27;re integrating XRP into everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892337&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892108&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CLL who also has most of their treasury in Link but is not incentivised to increase the price.&lt;br&gt;And they never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892414&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891011&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youre taking a CEOs words at face value because you think hes personally invested in making you rich. Thats not how this works. CEOs promote their companies and his job is to literally sell you link&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892515&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892337&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When will the gap close?&lt;br&gt;when the token will be needed for functioning of the network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892592&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891914&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The only thing that needs to happen to settle the debate is someone suing. And given chainlink seemingly gives zero fucks about it&amp;#x27;s holders it&amp;#x27;s probably long overdue.&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892185&lt;br&gt;I already mentioned it you fucking retard. You can see the ledger amendment history that they have spent their own dev money and time developing, their acquisitions of Hidden Road, etc. their getting binance listing RLUSD on the XRPL, the fact the early team specifically coded the ledger to explicitly default to its use and to save several percentage points over Ripplenet alone by doing so, the fact that they locked the vast bulk of their corporate treasury up in timed release in it, the fact they fund and partner with multiple large banks to drive and encourage its use and adoption, and the fact the services they are building out literally optimize using it and offer counterparty-less feature that no other asset onchain can, and the fact that they already use it in their business. They literally legally can&amp;#x27;t use it in most contexts yet but with clarity their business can become much more efficient and as a result their core holding increases in value. There is LITERALLY no reason to argue they are not building for its use other than being butthurt that it is true and trying to repress reality like a faggot. They literally have Fednow service providers running XRPL nodes and big banks who are their largest outside investors issuing bonds that reward in XRP (who were celebrated recently in their specific crypto efforts by the financial regulator of Japan) and are partnering with DBS (biggest bank in Singapore (Switzerland of Asia) and Franklin Templeton (trillion plus dollars AUM) building out a repo market on the XRPL. They got ONDO issuing on the XRPL, one of the largest asset managers in Europe/England doing same while basically no one is getting headway in England, Societe General (one of biggest banks in Europe) expanding to include XRP for their euro stablecoin which can bridge to RLUSD using XRP, etc. Literally everything they do builds around corporately driving XRP&amp;#x27;s adoption, literally just fleshing out a business sweet around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892679&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892659&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892185&lt;br&gt;This isn&amp;#x27;t even 10% of what could be said partnership etc. wise. XRP and link are different in that XRP actually improves business performance and has a reason to exist and incentivizes use in products. Link is literally just a toll booth jew token to insert costs where they would not technologically exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892108&lt;br&gt;The difference is CLL dumps on retail all the time and their business is not improved by the operation of link, it is a technologically pointless token, literally. Ripple hasn&amp;#x27;t sold publicly in over 5 years to retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892697&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;It will most likely be extremely violent the likes of which has literally never been seen before. I am very excited for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892933&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891755&lt;br&gt;you&amp;#x27;re practically crying, and they did not say that. I&amp;#x27;m sorry you bet on the wrong horse backed by criminals. to think swift is going to lose is unbelievable amounts of stupidity. haha why am i even talking to you, cya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892973&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893028&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;br&gt;I mean you&amp;#x27;re retarded and wrong but the cripplets are retarded and right. If that helps at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Idk if you link cucks have ever visited the /XSG/ threads but they are hardly ever discussing &amp;quot;muh utility&amp;quot; or even acknowledging other crypto. I&amp;#x27;m pretty sure they&amp;#x27;re currently going /X/ mode and trying to get a retard to be a sacrifice volunteer Mayan style to pump xrp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is hilarious. Anyway buy silver crypto fags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893103&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;br&gt;Really pathetic cope and projection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893028&lt;br&gt;Will it work though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893669&lt;br&gt;I meaann... it works for the jews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893824&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893717&lt;br&gt;Kek&lt;br&gt;SACRIFICE SPAMMY 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893980&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;fuck stinks&lt;br&gt;hate &amp;#x27;em&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895158&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892659&lt;br&gt;just look up xrpl code documentation and you will see what a grifter project it is. The hard fact is that no one (relatively speaking) compared to EVM based chains is using it. anything tokenization wise or project wise absolutely PALES against ethereum, thats a hard fact&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nuh uh, its used by dubai!!!!! and usage will increase 10000000x in the next few months because of institutions!!!&lt;br&gt;yea, sure what if it doesn&amp;#x27;t? &lt;br&gt;Transaction count has been going down overall, just check xrp stats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895471&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895158&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and usage will increase 10000000x in the next few months because of institutions!!!&lt;br&gt;Ironic, link has the same problem. At least cripple requires you own some exerpies to do transactions on their network, unlike cucklink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897045&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895158&lt;br&gt;Eth activity pales in comparison to Canton or Base for RWA. XRP literally just overtook solana in RWA and is increasing faster than any other in the top 10, which again, it is rising through, literally just entering the RWA space like a few months ago. You faggots were saying &amp;quot;no one is using RLUSD/they are using it on ETH&amp;quot; not even realizing how retarded it sounded saying no one was using a token that launched 1 year ago at the time (which has meteorically risen since) or having understood the obvious play of liquidity vacuuming from eth by establishing presence there and tapering into XRPL use which is exactly what they are doing. To you it not immediately having the marketcap of tether and deliberately sacrificing openness the existing liquidity base in a strategically retarded play is evidence of your own rightness. XRP began seeing tokenization basically immediately after the SEC appeal was dropped after it endured 5 fucking years of lawfare through Ethgate, during which eth was retardedly given the regulatory free pass by Clayton/Gensler and co. across this entire time being used to mint assets and establish itself with an artificial legal advantage baked in by the Epstein crowd literally because it could not compete technologically and is expensive and slow and fragmented with none of the same capacity for a universal protocol level compliance features or the broadness of MPT or escrow capability etc., having to cobble together standards across issuers and bake VERY centralized trust into the model and force us into L2 end service Hell. The CCP and JPM bought 95% of ETH in the ICO and tried to subvert actual defi and crypto and trojan horse us into digital slavery hell rather than allowing better technologies to win that can scale at L1 with built in compliance capabilities. Same reason they deliberately subverted bitcoin&amp;#x27;s build to be unusable as cash without scaling into shitty turbo-centralized L2s that are still too slow and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897098&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895158&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897045&lt;br&gt;XRP is certainly having to play catch up for the literal sole reason that it was targeted for lawfare despite ETH very obviously being much closer to a traditional security than it with XRP not even having had an ICO, but claiming victory now is pretty fucking retarded and acting like people will just continue to use worse tech for no reason other than that they did before. This is like saying low cost highspeed rail transport or refrigerated semis would be rejected because horse and buggies and old school carrier automobiles exist and we can strap big engine onto them if we wanted and industry corporatists alligned to fight them early on. At one point the same argument would have been equally valid (completely retarded). Or saying banks will use bitcoin for high frequency payments. This is obviously retarded. We are in the late 90s in the internet technology analogy. We literally don&amp;#x27;t even have regulatory clarity for market structure yet. But it is all coming together now, many will be wiped out, the level regulatory playing field will change a LOT and it would have been fucking retarded to say Netscape won internet with unassailable moat because it was so dominant early (where is it now?). XRPL is being built out as the liquidity base of core institutional services, repo market between trillions AUM Franklin Templeton and DBS (largest bank in Singapore (Switzerland of Asia)), used by ONDO with the creator of ONDO launching a video detailing how RLUSD offramps and XRPL can be used to link Black Rock&amp;#x27;s BUIDL to other member participants&amp;#x27; in ONDO (Wisdom Tree, Franklin Templeton etc.) other products etc. You are claiming to have won because you were allowed to tie your biggest challenger&amp;#x27;s arms who only needs a few innings to crush you, in the first two innings, and you STILL didn&amp;#x27;t even win vs. others in pic related. Lol XRPL payment volume has been going UP while ALL markedly of crypto has been going DOWN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895158&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897045&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897098&lt;br&gt;Further, XRP has proportionately outperformed any other asset over the last several years of launch in ETFs, and crushes every other crypto based one that launched alongside it, ESPECIALLY link, despite literally launching the day after the big downturn started months ago on MUCH smaller early issuers than other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>European funds for an american — 42 replies — 168.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61890472</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61890472?lm=1771961902</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 19:38:22 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;European funds for an american&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61890472'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 42 • Updated: 2026-02-24 19:38 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to put 20% of my account in foreign, but not all foreign is created equal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I predicted the rise in the polish economy. It&amp;#x27;s very simple, a homogenous white country free from communism is always going to become rich. A diverse country full of communists like Canada and South Africa is going to get worse and worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also predicted that the real-estate market in Croatia would sky rocket due to whites fleeing countries like the UK. I was right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So.... are there any good mutual/index funds that target the white regions of Europe, that an American can invest in? Is there a Balkans fund? A Baltic fund? Norway/Finland fund (not Sweden or Denmark)? I do not want to invest in the UK, France, Germany, or Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890485&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;finland&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;white&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890499&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;please buy my bag&lt;br&gt;nein. Death to every communist, that includes every single member of a political party, everyone over 50, every bureaucrat and every single subsidized &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; which in europe is every company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890518&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No fucking way those numbers on finland are right. I live in Helsinki and it’s like 25% brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890868&lt;br&gt;This is in fact, old data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891134&lt;br&gt;Yes. That&amp;#x27;s why I said funds that invest in Norway and Finland, but not Denmark and Sweden. I know Finland isn&amp;#x27;t really Nordic but they&amp;#x27;re next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891236&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891154&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s fine but from the average person&amp;#x27;s perspective you can&amp;#x27;t understand the bigger economic picture and appreciate the vast differences in market size and capital flows.&lt;br&gt;Life for average people may be more or less similar in Croatia and England but the English stock exchange is in another universe compared to these small economies.&lt;br&gt;As I said, I&amp;#x27;m an American living in Latvia. My life is better in Latvia. I&amp;#x27;m just a normal guy. The top 1% and .01% would see things quite differently. Where does one park $100,000,000 in the Baltics?&lt;br&gt;Answer: you don&amp;#x27;t. And downstream from that is YOU don&amp;#x27;t get to invest $50,000 in an Estonia market ETF either. These are frontier markets not even as developed as Brazil or India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891243&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891003&lt;br&gt;Euskadi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891236&lt;br&gt;I think real-estate, and downstream from that medical services, are pretty simple by and large because they&amp;#x27;re mostly just a matter of predicting the migration patterns of middle class white people, while avoiding the political behavior of lumpenprole voters. At a bare minimum investing in medical services and realestate are a safe bet in any communist free white flight destination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question then becomes, what financial products are available to me that resemble that in any way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s a fund called NHCBHFFT that invests in real estate in estonia, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891396&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I do not want to invest in the UK&lt;br&gt;FTSE100 has been outperforming the S&amp;amp;P500 for a while now but okay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891622&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891396&lt;br&gt;I want a stock that will perform well long term, the UK, like Canada and South Africa, has not future unless it claws it&amp;#x27;s way back from Weimar conditions. The massive white flight that has already taken place and has been accelerating, looks exactly how things looked for Detroit, Chicago, Oakland, Baltimore, etc... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghettofication is an economy killer. Because people ignore it and it makes people irrational, that is the area an investor can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892062&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;Brown migration is stagnating across Europe and so is the birthrate of migrants of the 2nd/3rd generation. The number of migrants are not big enough to not be outbred in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;This is probably based on early 90s data when Bulgaria was full of gypsies, France was full of North Africans, but the rest of the countries were fine.&lt;br&gt;Now Bulgarian gypsies are also abroad and the roles are reversed, lol (except for France, that&amp;#x27;s only getting worse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892365&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892062&lt;br&gt;sounds like copium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892695&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892062&lt;br&gt;White flight is the real economy killer. Again, look at all the places already mentioned. Niggers in america don&amp;#x27;t have exceptional birthrates but once they&amp;#x27;re 20% of a city everyone else runs away. Same as true for states and countries. Most nigger cities in America have half the population they had the in 60s. Akron and Cleveland have lost about half of their population due to white flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892982&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890855&lt;br&gt;This. &lt;br&gt;I’m polish and I can explain a bit just to give a gist. &lt;br&gt;Poland’s “capitalist” period started in ‘89 so to this day the biggest companies included in WIG20 are completely controlled by National Treasury. So 8 of them constitute about 55% of the index. &lt;br&gt;So mind you by loading up on indexes you’re not really buying innovation rather iron clad businesses that aren’t really growth oriented. &lt;br&gt;Let’ take an example of searching for growth sectors like everyone talks about polish developers so it would be safe to assume that IT stuff has growth potential. &lt;br&gt;And here the biggest IT company is CD project which makes fucking games a dying industry that will be killed by small teams with ai making indie games. &lt;br&gt;Rest of well known IT firms are privately owned or controlled by ventures. &lt;br&gt;It’s hard to really find good stuff I personally think you should search for companies making tangible products or services example solar panels, beauty sector, pharma. &lt;br&gt;We’ve got a lot of ecomerce, construction, pharma/cosmetics, news outlets. Not really innovative stuff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean I wish it was different but really if someone made something meaningful here he would be molested to death by venture capital like CVC Capital Partners and eventually cave in take cash run and live a beautiful trad life in Bielsko Biała.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892982&lt;br&gt;Cont.&lt;br&gt;So to comparing to the US, Poland is a polar opposite. &lt;br&gt;In the US Capital lobbies politics. In Poland the only people who can lobby are foreign players and people with political power. And this political power has more influence on the stock market while in the US stock market and capital makes politics. &lt;br&gt;The end communist era ripples through Poland up to this day. The people responsible for the transition made themselves very powerful and control the capital to this day. The good news it that their descendants are retarded beyond comprehension and will be unable to maintain power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892695&lt;br&gt;They will just flee from one city to another, Germans aren&amp;#x27;t moving from Germany to go to fucking Poopland lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895226&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Balkans&lt;br&gt;ha haha hahahahahahaha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895249&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893067&lt;br&gt;That doesn&amp;#x27;t sound like good news&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895250&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;South Korea, Japan and Brazil.&lt;br&gt;Lmao if you want to put it into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895308&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;Check how cucked European stocks are with regards to taxes.&lt;br&gt;The only European stocks i would invest in are stocks listed in London Stock Exchange for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895226&lt;br&gt;The Balkans are probably majority white now, because all of the gyppos are here in Finland and other Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895890&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;Look into EU military companies. Saab, Rheinmetall etc. have had huge growth and are still on the rise.&lt;br&gt;Also whatever alternative renewables there are. (Things like synthetic fuels and deep geothermal)&lt;br&gt;Also companies that are processing rare earths and minerals. It is expected that the Europeans will start to extract those resources soon. The usual structure is that companies from outside the EU can mine, but are contractually obligated to sell most of the resources to companies inside of the Union for processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also tech is fine. Plenty of EU countries are turning their backs towards US tech. Many government offices are currently swapping to different software, mostly open source. Expect EU companies to code scaleable European solutions soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895901&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Pole pretending to be amerifat in order to brag about his all white country that for some reason has the biggest diaspora of europoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895911&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that the Netherlands introduces a retarded tax on unrealized gains (after letting in milliions of low IQ migrants) Switzerland stands alone as an investable country in Europe. Barring a few microstates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t invest in Norway even though this is a fake thread made by a pole to brag about his shithole. Anyone wealthy in Norway is looking for an exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895901&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m from Ohio.&lt;br&gt;Like 90% of white people in Ohio, I&amp;#x27;m Irish and German. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895912&lt;br&gt;Norway will continue to be a place for whites to move to so long as it remains whiter than sweden. White flight is the biggest predictor that kikes and faggots ignore. You can only beat the market when there is something that makes the professionals behave irrationally. Race and Politics make people behave irrationally. Thus racist investing is the ultimate way to beat the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895991&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895911&lt;br&gt;Countries that are developing after finally being free from communism, are going to be the countries with the most growth potential. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kind of retarded if you can&amp;#x27;t understand how a country that has only been free for a couple decades has more development opportunity than a mature country where everything has already been built and now there&amp;#x27;s this massive parasitic government that has grown fat off the riches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896194&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895983&lt;br&gt;You think there will be substantial white flight to Thailand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896239&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896194&lt;br&gt;Asia is a different topic. &lt;br&gt;But the high IQ Asian countries that are becoming capitalist later than their neighbors, have the most growth opportunity. So I think Vietnam is the next south Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896307&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895312&lt;br&gt;wrong just like in india there&amp;#x27;s gorilion more to go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896368&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890518&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s probably an old map also browns are settled at the main city&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897083&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895983&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Thus racist investing is the ultimate way to beat the market.&lt;br&gt;I thought that when I bought a Russian ETF and that money is now frozen and probably gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897116&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893067&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The good news it that their descendants are retarded beyond comprehension and will be unable to maintain power.&lt;br&gt;They just have to be ruthless and savvy, not necessarily smart. It&amp;#x27;s hard to lose when you start the game at the finish line resting on a pile of gold while everyone else scrambles to work their whole life to buy a house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mac minis are the new ASIC miners — 46 replies — 147.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893434</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893434?lm=1771960785</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 19:19:45 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Mac minis are the new ASIC miners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893434'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 46 • Updated: 2026-02-24 19:19 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac minis are like the ASIC miners except they do actual work instead of mining bitcoin for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893585&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893434&lt;br&gt;What are people even doing with their 50 mac mini AI agents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893611&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893585&lt;br&gt;Its like a team of 50 indians&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893612&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893611&lt;br&gt;Just imagine the sound of 50 echoing good morning sirs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895152&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;they are not actually hosting models on those minis lmao, its set up solely so that openclaw doesn&amp;#x27;t disintegrate the OS of your main daily driver computer which often happens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895163&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894122&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The latest apple minis are 5x faster than equivalent costing PCs at running AI&lt;br&gt;Pure bullshit and you don&amp;#x27;t know shit about technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unified memory bandwith is nice but you only get real benefits with something like M3 Ultra and even then, a properly set up PC inference workstation with real GPU&amp;#x27;s will beat the macs token times by a fair margin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is with current RAM prices and how scarce GPU&amp;#x27;s with decent VRAM are the Mac is actually a viable alternative to putting a rig together, even if it gets a bit less tokens per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does AI actually do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895196&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895191&lt;br&gt;Create asset bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895198&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895191&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895251&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895191&lt;br&gt;What do You actually do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This message was written by:&lt;br&gt;50 macs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895338&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893611&lt;br&gt;imagine the smell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895344&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895338&lt;br&gt;jej is make me laugh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895377&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893611&lt;br&gt;minus the shitting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895732&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895163&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;even then, a properly set up PC inference workstation with real GPU&amp;#x27;s will beat the macs token times by a fair margin &lt;br&gt;Not at the same price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895740&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895377&lt;br&gt;Plus they can work 24 hours a day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895338&lt;br&gt;Apple shouldn&amp;#x27;t actually produce smells because it&amp;#x27;s considered a premium product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895757&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895191&lt;br&gt;Glorified googling program. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve tried to use AI to diagnose some tricky health issues I’ve had and while it did help at first, I’m pretty sure it eventually tried to kill me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895762&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895732&lt;br&gt;If it was &amp;#x27;the same price&amp;#x27; people would choose the faster option, aka notMac. The problem with the cheap option here being - again - you can cool GPUs and they are somewhat designed to be ran at high temps for extended periods. Mac Minis weren&amp;#x27;t and aren&amp;#x27;t. And these retards are going to fry their Mactrash, abusing them 24/7 as retarded AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;you really don&amp;#x27;t need a mac mini, old Lenovo Thinkcenters work perfectly fine and you get get a used one with 32GB of ram and 2 TB of disk space for like $200-300&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been using a few with Unbuntu installed to run a bunch of agents on an isolated Vlan at home. (These things are honestly security risks, don&amp;#x27;t give them access to your home network or personal info)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895820&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895757&lt;br&gt;chatgpt is useless now, its a glorified yes man. You can actually trick it into giving horrific advice. Which puts it at the level of a 32 year old life coach, nothing more. Gemini is a good tool if you can get a local unit to run, great for helping map and document trades. But nothing more than that, if you really needed something to bounce ideas off of it isn&amp;#x27;t that. But that is all you can expect out of it, a really good calculator. It&amp;#x27;s when people expect it to be a thinking breathing human is when problems arise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895868&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895788&lt;br&gt;And what model can you on 32gb ram? Thinkcentres dont have dedicated gpu do they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895868&lt;br&gt;no one is running the actual model locally, this is for running the agent and all its tools, most people are running API calls off Openrouter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895922&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895888&lt;br&gt;These ARE running local models, that&amp;#x27;s the entire point of using MacMinis and unified RAM. Whether the Minis will survive the experience, is another issue entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896004&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895757&lt;br&gt;Interesting. &lt;br&gt;Mine kept saying im trans. Kek! &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; sadface.jpg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894156&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;give the mac mini all of my personal info, financial data, passwords, internet browsing history etc.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a personal computer. It already has all of those things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896031&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895820&lt;br&gt;Yes that’s pretty much it. Although it did help me diagnose leaky gut issues and initially helped with some supplements, but then it started telling me to basically OD on magnesium and electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896090&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894238&lt;br&gt;Rent it to people that are scared of running it locally or too stupid to figure it out.&lt;br&gt;Stuff like this https://seafloor.bot/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896126&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically in the future everyone will have their own personal agentic AI, and these people are hosting them while its still hard to get it set up.&lt;br&gt;This isnt a sustainable business model tho, because its only a matter of time before soke big company like google starts doing it with infinitely more success because they actually have all the data from everyone, so the AI assistant will come out of factory already knowing you better than you know yourself.&lt;br&gt;But it will be profitable probably for a 1 or 2. I dont see this stuff getting released by a big company before its tested enough to ensure most of the nightmarish stories being reported about openclaw have a close to 0% chance of happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896174&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893434&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;they do actual work&lt;br&gt;how much money has your agent made?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896193&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895922&lt;br&gt;No they aren&amp;#x27;t. They&amp;#x27;re just a bunch of iToddlers who can&amp;#x27;t into Raspberry Pi or Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896922&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896126&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;knowing you better than you know yourself&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s actually pretty hard to personalize large language models, so dont expect the same behaviour as you have from your tiktok or youtube algorithm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896954&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is pure retardium. the minis are not running shit. they can&amp;#x27;t run any models, and anyways open models are not worth running, they&amp;#x27;re dumb as rocks&lt;br&gt;openclaw uses api to run, claude because it&amp;#x27;s the only one that can do shit. the fattest claude (the only able one) can burn hundreds of $$$ per day. and you don&amp;#x27;t need a mac mini for it. you can just run it on the cloud or in a virtual machine. it&amp;#x27;s really lean on resources - you just need to pay a lot of money for the api&lt;br&gt;dumb. all of it is just dumb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896995&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895757&lt;br&gt;Must be a canadian llm, MAID GPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896193&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the same software. If you can&amp;#x27;t into linux then you definitely can&amp;#x27;t into macos. Both start up into a first class GUI and both require you to drop to the command line to install LLM shit because that&amp;#x27;s how the software works. Ollama front ends not withstanding.&lt;br&gt;Hell, raspi clusters are easy mode because it far easier to find a prebaked recipe you can copy/paste to get it all running whereas mac users have to deal with retards hardcoding paths and cuda bullshit into their workflows.&lt;br&gt;That said there is some retardation going on with the mac buying. Macs are the sane choice because they are the absolute cheapest way to get more than 64GB with GPU access to that pool. Your 128GB of DDR5 and a xeon doesn&amp;#x27;t compare. Buying a joblot of 16GB mac minis is defeating the purpose though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>/smg/ - BUT WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON??? edition — 32 replies — 128.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61896953</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61896953?lm=1771961790</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 19:36:30 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;/smg/ - BUT WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON??? edition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61896953'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 32 • Updated: 2026-02-24 19:36 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Some helpful links to numb the pain&lt;br&gt;https://findahelpline.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.nvidia.com/refunds/&lt;br&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/refunds&lt;br&gt;https://jlingz.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Educational sites:&lt;br&gt;https://www.investopedia.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Financial TV Streams:&lt;br&gt;https://www.newslive.com/american/cnbc.html&lt;br&gt;https://www.livestreamy.net/bloomberg/&lt;br&gt;destiny.gg/bigscreen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Charts:&lt;br&gt;https://www.tradingview.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.finscreener.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Screeners: so you feel like in the movies&lt;br&gt;https://finviz.com/&lt;br&gt;https://etfdb.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Gambling:&lt;br&gt;https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/&lt;br&gt;https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com&lt;br&gt;https://optionstrat.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.optionistics.com/quotes/option-prices&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Pre-Market and Live data:&lt;br&gt;https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures&lt;br&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Calendars&lt;br&gt;https://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendar&lt;br&gt;https://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar&lt;br&gt;https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html&lt;br&gt;https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/data/building-permits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Boomer Investing 101: so zoomers with meme stocks can outperform you&lt;br&gt;https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started&lt;br&gt;https://www.sec.gov/search-filings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Misc smg:&lt;br&gt;https://www.financialjuice.com/home&lt;br&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers&lt;br&gt;https://market24hclock.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.dividendchannel.com/drip-returns-calculator&lt;br&gt;https://brokerchooser.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.chathamfinancial.com/technology/us-market-rates&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous smigger thread&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895463&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896959&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896953&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895463&lt;br&gt;Should I take the ~90k i saved my first year practicing law for a down payment and try to make it?

I&amp;#x27;m sure they&amp;#x27;re overcharging the fuck out of them, but I fail to see how it&amp;#x27;s such a threat to their system if they&amp;#x27;re so enthusiastic about selling it physically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896708&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896642&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but I fail to see how it&amp;#x27;s such a threat to their system if they&amp;#x27;re so enthusiastic about selling it physically.&lt;br&gt;You are correct, it&amp;#x27;s clearly not. No financial instrument will ever threaten (((them))) anyway, they literally master it. No, the only thing they fear can hardly be called an investment (at least for the ones involved) : it is few thousands determined goyim going full Luigi, but that&amp;#x27;s not happening anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896808&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896601&lt;br&gt;politicians and bankers are the biggest Bitcoin and crypto investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896881&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896808&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That should probably tell you something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896924&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61896708&lt;br&gt;Agreed fully.

The reality is that you owe tax according to your income bracket which means that if you make around $60k per year you only owe 12% on precious metals capital gains.

Something about Lemon and all the crypto problems being solved - nobody uses it though. Least embarrassing price action on list&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALGO - tranny dump already happened, was leading DiFi platform and was pretty decent for dApps. Dead now that all of that is dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ICP - muh Caffeine app builder and distributed compute. Only &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; token to do a 1/1000x (2k -&amp;gt; $2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LINK - honestly, I am not sure what LINK does, something about oracles and sending JSON objects&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GOLD - more gooder if Iran bombed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XRP - I don&amp;#x27;t know what XRP does, is it like a replacement for USDC for replacing FedWire? Banks aren&amp;#x27;t ready to adopt it yet and still use USDC. Also not sure what it does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serious question though, which of these or similar can pump?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, if you want to tell me what they do, I would genuinely appreciate it.

Not CRP. Although there is an option to ise On Demand Liquidity which replies on XRP. Obviously this is supplemental at best and can&amp;#x27;t supplant transferring actually USD available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891937&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890886&lt;br&gt;Imo buying across any mix of the following will be solid longterm:&lt;br&gt;XRP, QNT, CC, XDC, ALGO (possibly dead, but in quantum age may shine for sake of superior tech), DAG, HBAR, XLM, SUI, SEI, APT, FLR, ONDO, NOM, ADA, HYPE, SOL, POL, ATOM, DAG, AAVE, DOT, VET, ZRO, RED, HYPE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is a pretty good rundown of the XRP use cases at present from specifically Ripple&amp;#x27;s operation perspective:&lt;br&gt;https://ripple.com/insights/institutional-defi-on-xrpl-scaling-real-world-finance-with-xrp-at-the-core/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891947&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891060&lt;br&gt;Ripple&amp;#x27;s whole strategy is (just like RLUSD launching on Eth and moving to XRPL) to meet the liquidity where it is and move it to the XRPL. Multiple banks already use XRP but many cannot until Clarity passes. XRPL optimizes using XRP and minted assets autobridge using it between different stable coin or minted asset issuances etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891961&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890935&lt;br&gt;Link doesn&amp;#x27;t do ANYTHING. It has ZERO utility and no one who invests in it even understands it, they just hear names that CLL has fireside chats with and presume this translates to token value despite it not doing so. The coin exists as a literally unnecessary rent seeker fee insertion. It doesn&amp;#x27;t solve efficiencies or have a basis for use, it is literally just specific jewry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890886&lt;br&gt;A LUST PROVOKING VIDEO?!?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FUCK YEAH!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892452&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890886&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;bitches will dress like clowns and dance like retards and will make 5 or 6 digits monthly while you wage like a slave for almost nothing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;i am in Hell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892733&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890886&lt;br&gt;Most of those chains are kinda dead now that DeFi and Dapps are old news, but there are--supposedly--a dozen or so council member use cases being worked on by Hedera council members, some of which are transferable, so could be adopted by other enterprises. That seems interesting. Repsol and Fed Ex are recent members and all new members are required to have a use case they are working on, and supply chains and energy tracking seem good fits for DLTs. Will take a looooong time, though, of course. &lt;br&gt;I really don&amp;#x27;t know if crypto has another pump-n-dump fad like NFTs, DeFi, Dapps etc left in it. It really might just be the long wait for mainstream institutional adoption (another reason why I rate Hedera over most others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892748&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892452&lt;br&gt;She is top 10% in looks genetically, 1% via not being fat and knowing how to appeal professionally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she were a male, she would be benching 315 for reps at sub 8% BF, running 3 miles in 18 minutes at 6&amp;#x27;1 with a 130 IQ and working a 200k+ job, and that&amp;#x27;s without connections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people have it easy, but it isn&amp;#x27;t gender-related. Average women get discarded at 35 at best. It&amp;#x27;s brutal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891060&lt;br&gt;So is that Ripples&amp;#x27; value prop? As mentioned, I do see banks trying to do wires via USDC (and then convert back to USD on both sides). Is XRP pretty much offering that. Thread was serious insofar that I really want to understand what each of these coins is trying to supposedly do. ALGO is the clearest for me (distributed apps), but that whole market died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891937&lt;br&gt;Going to go read this, brb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891937&lt;br&gt;Any preferences in that list - that&amp;#x27;s a long-ass list and I am maybe vaguely familiar with half at most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892764&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892733&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I really don&amp;#x27;t know if crypto has another pump-n-dump fad like NFTs, DeFi, Dapps etc left in it&lt;br&gt;That was the real issue with this cycle, there was no hype. Just Bitcoin-led, muh instituional adoption, zero other narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893117&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892748&lt;br&gt;It is a long list sort of intentionally so that I am not shilling anything. I think 99% of crypto will be valueless and a lot of it is reaching the runway end in the next year or two, especially with clarity, but a few dozen will thrive and emerge at minimum and of those I think are strong, this list if bought across in a diverse way, I think would more or less guarantee if crypto succeeds you do very well also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892452&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Blame it on the whore instead of the worthless simps&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrew Tate style &amp;quot;men&amp;quot; are so incredibly fucking gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894845&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it would be fun to fuck a chick dressed like this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894845&lt;br&gt;Yeah I always wanted to dress as a clown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895078&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;not a single coin does anything&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;you know how when you go to a convenience store and all the different scratch-offs have different names but they&amp;#x27;re all exactly the same thing? fancy packaging for what appears to be different themes but all designed to trick you out of your money&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thats what altcoins are, there are no exceptions, and everyone in the market understands this by now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895159&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890886&lt;br&gt;honestly, its way more bearish that prediction market coins aren&amp;#x27;t up bigly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895162&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891947&lt;br&gt;why would banks use rlusd or xrpl as a bridge currency when they can just atomically swap stablecoins? Theres no nostro-vostro in crypto, underlying assets can be sold anywhere instantly at any time, even automatically via smartcontracts or even put into liquidity pools for any overhead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896947&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895162&lt;br&gt;XRP is natively used on the XRP in cross minted asset swaps at a fraction of the cost and speed of off or cross ledger settlement with basically bottomless on demand liquidity so that low volume corridors don&amp;#x27;t get blown out and weird continuous markets don&amp;#x27;t need to be developed for an efficient universal system. XRP also has none of the risk inherent in smart contracts, is completely counterparty-less and using ILP the whole thing can scale to literally trillions of tps with fees paid in any currency, capable of micropayment batching. XRP is less risky, has no counterparty or contract risk and scales liquidity regardless of the currency pair instantly with no need to establish liquidity between the currency pairs let alone specific issuer walled garden tokens (USDC vs. USDT vs. RLUSD vs. every other national etc. stablecoin) and costs less and finalizes faster. Literally every single reason they would be considering is better done this way, with a few frictions as technically possible with current DLT and zero middlemen unless they choose to have them, completely decentralized, being able to atomic swap on ILP through their own chosen structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895078&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;jeet can&amp;#x27;t read solidity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>If you STILL haven't realized this is going to triple digits, then you should seriously consider seeing a medical profes… — 23 replies — 35.2/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61888568</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61888568?lm=1771959560</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 18:59:20 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;If you STILL haven&amp;#x27;t realized this is going to triple digits, then you should seriously consider seeing a medical profes…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61888568'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 23 • Updated: 2026-02-24 18:59 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you STILL haven&amp;#x27;t realized this is going to triple digits, then you should seriously consider seeing a medical professional about actual brain damage or tumor-induced mental retardation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888568&lt;br&gt;double digit shitcoin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888573&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888572&lt;br&gt;Oh, eventually, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888580&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888568&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888572&lt;br&gt;Moonboys GTFO.

There’s also already a mutiny happening with the troops, the US economy is already in recession and even normies are wising up to Israeli influence over the government.

LLMs are useful for some things but the notion that they are going to anything other than a glorified search engine needs to die. Yeah they are good a being a search engine, search engines are useful, but they suffer from the same problems as search engines, namely that a internet search can never actually tell you if the information it find is accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research needs to look an entirely different direction if they want true intelligence. We&amp;#x27;ve been working on text generators for decades so it shouldn&amp;#x27;t be surprising that we&amp;#x27;ve managed to perfect them, but the next breakthrough is going to come from something else we&amp;#x27;ve been working on for decades, not from incremental improvements to LLMs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who knows, maybe LLMs can aid in the research of this alternative field which will bring the next advancement? Using better technology to do research can cut down the years required so the accelerated nature of technology remains, but it is still going to come from somewhere people aren&amp;#x27;t expecting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LLMs can still be useful, but the costs associated with it are going to become prohibitive. Eventually they are going to just be like railways or telecoms which serve as an expensive base over which the next thing can emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893571&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;AGI is here as of two months ago, it&amp;#x27;s openclaw when using anything smarter than Opus 4.5. Companies are beginning to hire mac minis instead of people. If you still want to meme about r&amp;#x27;s in strawberry and pretend this isn&amp;#x27;t happening, that&amp;#x27;s at your own risk. You&amp;#x27;ll be out of a job sooner rather than later. My &amp;quot;glorified search engine&amp;quot; just built a whole tradingview clone for me and i cancelled my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ps, you should download a copy of the tradingview free charting library now. Because once they notice the potential damage it&amp;#x27;ll cause to their subscription profits they&amp;#x27;ll move it behind a B2B paywall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893618&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889716&lt;br&gt;Lololol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893632&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893571&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;job &lt;br&gt;Sir this is a business and finance board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893571&lt;br&gt;Producing a charting library for you is indeed a &amp;quot;glorified search engine&amp;quot;. Impressive no doubt, but all it really is doing is copying something that already exists. Like you said it wouldn&amp;#x27;t work without the library. So it is just searching and displaying things in a proper way. This seems very &amp;quot;Star Trek&amp;quot; where you can command a computer to display stuff for you, but it is still an unthinking computer doing this. It is not AGI, it is going to do a particular sets of tasks extraordinarily well, but it can&amp;#x27;t do everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally in terms of the economics of computing, having everyone needing to use an LLM to produce their own software clone is enormously inefficient. It makes sense right now only for two reasons:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Using AI is basically &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; for the end user. They aren&amp;#x27;t paying any associated costs yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Software is currently held back behind paywalls creating artificial scarcity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AI in practice is unlocking tons of value that is blocked by intellectual property laws, but getting around intellectual property laws is coming at the expense of mounting physical costs. We could have Free Software that is made efficiently and given away for cheap and that would be far less resource intensive that using LLMs to make personalized versions of everything for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a bit like the phenomena of computers constantly bloating in memory requirements because they have greater capacities. Old software was incredibly efficient, using only kilobytes, but now it uses gigabytes. AI produced software is using terrabytes. This trend will continue until our software demands become impossible to fufill in the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Computer Science there is a concept of complexity, which is how quickly something grows when its unit demands increase, and in some cases it might be linear, quadratic, or exponential. Other cases it is logarithmic and it is proportionally less intensive the more it is used. While now we are &amp;quot;hyperscaling&amp;quot;, that can&amp;#x27;t last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894075&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893850&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; all it really is doing is copying something that already exists&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s not how ai works. It learns the probability of existing text patterns from training data, and then uses those probabilities to output original text. Which isn&amp;#x27;t the same as copypasting existing github repos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and that chart library is only like half my codebase. It got the app up and running quickly but if I wanted to I could have the ai replace that file in a day or two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether it&amp;#x27;s the US or China who reaches AGI first, they will not be making it public nor implement it into public LLMs for a very long time. The military and intel community will get first dibs for national security reasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896793&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889694&lt;br&gt;AI bubble is going to pop buddy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896825&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889694&lt;br&gt;Why pay agi when you can unperson those who won&amp;#x27;t work and don&amp;#x27;t provide value?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896837&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893571&lt;br&gt;based, did you use lightweight charts? i want to do this so i can make tick charts without paying out the ass for them, but i haven&amp;#x27;t yet. its truly incredible what a smart person and ai can do together. the things im doing with efficient regularization are pretty crazy, i doubt i&amp;#x27;d ever have the patience to do it on my own, much better to be an idiot ceo telling the hyper competent assistant to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>WHY IS THIS HAPPENING — 5 replies — 19.7/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61894507</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61894507?lm=1771960996</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 19:23:16 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;WHY IS THIS HAPPENING&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61894507'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 5 • Updated: 2026-02-24 19:23 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY IS THIS HAPPENING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894520&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894507&lt;br&gt;Because the crypto president extracted the goyim and kept all the money for himself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894523&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894520&lt;br&gt;I should of fucking sold holy fuck im down 70k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894556&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894523&lt;br&gt;get out while you still can. i warned you all. cash is king&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61896883&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894507&lt;br&gt;because it must. it&amp;#x27;s over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897038&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894507&lt;br&gt;Because ultimately BTC has no value and isn&amp;#x27;t backed by satanic globalist crime lords like how fiat is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
