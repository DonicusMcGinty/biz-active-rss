I don&amp;#x27;t blame you, though. The whole system is rigged against you from birth and every aspect of your human nature is weaponized against you by the very thing you&amp;#x27;re meant to worship as a social animal, i.e. society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860601&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858970&lt;br&gt;They just gave away all our money to Ausländers and now that the social systems are running dry they are simply getting rid of them kek.&lt;br&gt;Nothing they do will fix this. Humanity is doomed.&lt;br&gt;Accelerationism is the only way.&lt;br&gt;Let the third world starve and divert fund into AI datacenters.&lt;br&gt;The wolf will chew its own leg off to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860612&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860601&lt;br&gt;third world is the biggest net exporter of food to the point frenchoids were crying it would kill their overpriced artistical wine or something, they aint starving bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860626&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860591&lt;br&gt;Sorry chief, I find the idea of opening a business to be enticing but I don’t see any sort of moat I could pursue with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860651&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858970&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858974&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860660&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860612&lt;br&gt;Africa imports a lot of food&lt;br&gt;And France was rightfully complaining that imposing huge restrictions on European agriculture while signing free trade agreements with countries having little restrictions is retarded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860678&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859446&lt;br&gt;a 10% reduction? kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860682&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860422&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;10 year gap&lt;br&gt;I tell them it is due to the government forcing employers to lower standards to hire the affirmative action subhumans. They never call me back, because they are off giving useless lazy meritless and sometime convict affirmative action subhumans jobs. &lt;br&gt;Enjoy paying to taxes to niggers, spics, and cunts that hate you, just in the vain hopes they one day stop calling you a racist and sexist. Get back to work wagie... the whole economy rests on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860191&lt;br&gt;Gas?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860707&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860422&lt;br&gt;kek, they won&amp;#x27;t work at all, german economy will implode and as merz said they already can&amp;#x27;t afford the welfare + pensions, it will just shrink till it gets too low to live then they will just kys as by now they are legit unable to live at all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860723&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859099&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;this nigga thinks German economy circa 1988 is anything like today&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol&lt;br&gt;Lmao even&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860724&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860401&lt;br&gt;a drooly retard eh? yeah that sounds just perfect for our new expanded military, the bundeswehr needs you to pick this uniform, this little sign and just stand there to block the evil russian drones with your face for us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860758&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tfw the only time in my life where I might receive neetbux for a few months is the exact time this happens&lt;br&gt;fucking lol my entire life is me getting fucked by the universe.

The previous government eased up on some of the welfare restrictions because they were largely pointless. The new(old) sanctions don&amp;#x27;t really change anything because even with them you can be permanently on welfare in Germany as long as you show up to your jobcenter appointments. Nobody in Germany is going to hire someone who hasn&amp;#x27;t worked for years and is clearly just applying because the jobcenter is pressuring them. This is just a huge waste of everyone&amp;#x27;s time and part of Germany&amp;#x27;s soviet-tier obscuring of unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860422&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It&amp;#x27;ll be hard to explain the 10+ year gap&lt;br&gt;16 years gapmaxxer here, would you hire me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862208&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every nation has 10% unemployable retards. What to do with them?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;send them into the meatgrinder&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;employ them for the least possible payment&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;give them fake jobs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;giver them life long gibs payed by everyone else&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nation can do any of these without problems. BUT: If you open your borders and let the 10% retards of the entire third world in, you can not give them gibs anymore or you risk financial collapse. Especially if you destroy your own industry and energy security. The meatgrinder is then the only viable solution. Prepare for a war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862662&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860724&lt;br&gt;getting out from Bundeswehr cuckery is even easier than getting welfare.&lt;br&gt;just fake mental illness and you cant work there. ez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862678&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862662&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s for now buddy, things will change pretty fast when we attack those pesky russians to save EVROPA, our poor refugees can&amp;#x27;t go, so its time for private retard from munich to catch a drone, you are legit stupid and not only faking if you believe all that goodwill shit won&amp;#x27;t dissapear from the constitution as soon as they need meat, you will be the retard brick to the new EU federation, be glad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862777&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862678&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tfw only germans have to serve in the Volksfront&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;12% of our pop doesn&amp;#x27;t even have a german pass&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tfw they are getting welfare and Neetmax while i&amp;#x27;m send off to the grinder after taxing the shit out of my market gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862781&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;why would you give people free money for burgers? lazy europoops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862784&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859975&lt;br&gt;reminder the leaders are all boomers but when you point this out some tranny will start screaming to stop blaming the boomers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All it takes is for non-elderly people to rise up and say &amp;quot;get the fuck out of my way grandpa or I will cave your head in&amp;quot; and there&amp;#x27;s nothing they can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862797&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860147&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s despicable. these assholes come here, shit up our culture and behave like the are welcome here. cultures should be kept separate. you have to go back to /pol/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863548&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862678&lt;br&gt;nothing will happen.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;muh WW3&lt;br&gt;is a nothingburger like covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863561&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860422&lt;br&gt;your cat&amp;#x27;s litterbox needs changing, roastie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863615&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859111&lt;br&gt;but not civil rights (since they invaded)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866483&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859010&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;otherwise politicians would actually have to do something. news cycle is 50% immigration and 50% buergergeld which is not a gigantic slice of the money pie, then they bicker 3 years and rename the thing and change one integer, just like launching a shitcoin and changing the port. then they&amp;#x27;ve done enough work for one legislative period and resume partying on epstein island&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us? — 26 replies — 104.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796?lm=1771352502</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:21:42 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 26 • Updated: 2026-02-17 18:21 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys in the EU make less than us on paychecks, but you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare and PTO while we have to pay for private insurance which chronically denies people&amp;#x27;s health situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are people saying that starting a business in the EU is difficult because of the regulations? What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends enormously on which country are we talking about. Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860823&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;How about the Czech Republic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860836&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure&lt;br&gt;we have them too except they&amp;#x27;re called &amp;quot;pre authorization&amp;quot; and we still get to pay for it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860837&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re shitting me right? As the other guy said it really varies based on the country, but in places like Italy you need 20 authorizations and 10 certifications (that you pay for) to open something like a bar or a carpentry shop, plus constant &amp;quot;controls&amp;quot; which are basically bribe requests at this point by officials of all kinds. Oh, and good luck filing your taxes. Here&amp;#x27;s how it goes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; be business owner&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; tax filing time (yay)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; because of course YOU need to tell the state how much the state wants from YOU&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; slightest fuck up? You&amp;#x27;re on the hook for 240% of the original amount&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; they have 5-7 years to come after you&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;oh hello here&amp;#x27;s a tax bill from 5 years ago cause you filed 3.51 euros less than you were supposed to, plus 1500 eur sanction, plus interest&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; oh btw you pay FIRST, and MAYBE when (after an average of 12 years in court at your expense) you are declared right, you get it back, no interest accrued, your legal expenses still on your back&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; so most people just pay&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; it&amp;#x27;s mafia with a hand of paint on top and the full force of the state behind it&lt;br&gt;EU is completely fucked. Stay away. We can just pray it somehow implodes from within.

I mean they&amp;#x27;re telling you know that you&amp;#x27;re ruled upon by a bunch of satanist jew pedophiles and there&amp;#x27;s no shooting in the streets, so there you have it. But at least you have the guns. If the Cheka comes knocking at your door demanding your harvest and your daughters, you can shoot back at the fuckers. Here in EU we&amp;#x27;re basically at the mercy of a state that hates us and wants us dead, and we have only our dicks to hold in our hands to defend ourselves from it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860860&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;As far as I keep reading on economic subreddits, negligible, the US just has far more available credit and tax companies a bit less at start allowing them to grow, otherwise its basically the same, sounds legit just a complacency issue from europeans, most of the time they get more unemployment benefits than they would working and have legit no time limit for them so they just don&amp;#x27;t bother lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860967&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;in my country, the one thing one has to look out for is paying for your own social/healthinsurance, ie, if you have your own business, you need to pay taxes for your own health/socialinsurance, and the taxman wont ask you for the first 3y of that business.&lt;br&gt;After the 3y pass, you will then have to payup all the retrospective social insurance tax costs incurred, which fucks over a lot of retard or unfortunate first business owners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861032&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;This is why we need a unified EU business regulation and undermind the corrupt sovereignist that want to keep individual burocratic fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861057&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Some are easy (Germany)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; some are very hard (Italy)&lt;br&gt;let me guess italian never tried germany?&lt;br&gt;Germany is known to be a bureucracy hellhole with people fleeing to other countries from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;unified will fix it&lt;br&gt;France&amp;amp;germany have been dictating eu lawmaking. You will eat shit as you already do. You have eu wide higher taxes because germany didnt want to compete and made mandatory higher minimum vat a thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to mention that countries that joined got their industries destroyed by unified regulation and had to import from germany/france what they used to produce themself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the one thing the USA gets right. I personally made a &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; (that never made any profit) in the span of an afternoon. Cost maybe $200 to get my identification numbers for the llc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861091&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;yeah let&amp;#x27;s give the EU bureaucrats more power that will fix it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;br&gt;Depends on the business. If you want to do something shady the US is the place to go. The US has barely any standards and barely any regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure&lt;br&gt;What are you talking about? I live currently in the EU and have never had to wait for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861119&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Us is easier.&lt;br&gt;I have created 2 corpos and 1 llc for different purposes within the past 8 years. You can do it all online for a few bucks, other regulations depend on specific industry but overall it&amp;#x27;s pretty easy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861128&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;higher taxation alone puts euros at a disadvantage. Its fine if you do a local job since you compete with locals but anything online / shipped its bad since they have to be more efficient than rest of world to reach same profit margin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for amount of bureaucracy its fucking complex and depends on what country and what profession. There is even stupid shit like if you run a repair shop and repair inside your building it counts different than if you decide to drive to your customer and repair locally. In the later case they classify you as a handyman worker and will fine you if you didn&amp;#x27;t register with the craftsman ministry. Also if you do something you didn&amp;#x27;t register for you will also be fined but you can register as &amp;quot; i will do anything&amp;quot; more broadly and dodge it. The amount of bullshit can easily fill a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends on what your goals are, the type of business, your personal goals and the markets you wish to enter. In general it&amp;#x27;s more of an investment in the long run but if you plan to offer your services or products in the EU anyway it makes sense to start your business here and already be compliant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure.&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I remember waiting decades for my appendicitis, it rupturing and me dying because of it. Thankfully they could keep me alive for months despite the extreme difficulties this poses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;We need more unified European regulation. Sadly the EU is not an economic alliance anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;I love how hard it is to even talk about european economy on reddit, not because of europeans, but because of american lefties, if you so much, and most times you don&amp;#x27;t even need to, mention the US, they will flock like a horde to claim the US lies about everything, that 30% of americans are unemployed and nearly no one in europe, the EU is literal worker&amp;#x27;s paradise and how much they love their welfare policies and hate the US greed, its quite hilarious really how much they want a nanny state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is, soon it will was once EU Inc comes into play&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yea but you have to wait 1 year+ because there is a million niggers in queue before you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865645&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861057&lt;br&gt;Lol this is true.&lt;br&gt;Germany and France made the EU suck with their shit like GDPR etc. Spain happily sniffs every turd. The rest aren&amp;#x27;t better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your efforts are starting to go anywhere, your own government will make sure, you won&amp;#x27;t get any further.&lt;br&gt;They hate nothing more than citizens that are not dependent on them. That&amp;#x27;s why they are allowing third world people in to the maximum extent physically possible, that are never going end up being a &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; on the balance sheet, but that they hope will be cheap voting sheep for their party. The people pay for them after all, not the party.&lt;br&gt;Effectively: If Elon Musk was a citizen of a EU-country, he&amp;#x27;d already be in jail waiting for the sentence to be sent to prison. You probably don&amp;#x27;t want to get into that situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>GET MONERO (XMR) - The Time is NOW — 13 replies — 52.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61859030</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61859030?lm=1771352840</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:27:20 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;GET MONERO (XMR) - The Time is NOW&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61859030'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 13 • Updated: 2026-02-17 18:27 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;unrealized capital gains taxes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;stablecoins everywhere (CBDCs by another name)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;surveillance everywhere&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;AI completely opens up all non-private chains&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is ONLY ONE coin that will be used in the future.

Massive AI layoffs, causing incredible levels of unemployment. The need for “UBI” (CBDC tracking all transactions and censoring ones “they” don’t like). Hopelessness for the future of work. People wondering what the point of their pathetic lives are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least Monero can give you a semblance of sovereignty. And it will be in extremely high demand as the only untraceable form of digital money. So you’ll get rich too, whatever that means in 2030+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859940&lt;br&gt;More like society becomes so unstable you&amp;#x27;ll only survive by trading outside the UBI ration system.

Soon an other Capital idling necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864333&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863679&lt;br&gt;Capital final crisis since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864989&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863206&lt;br&gt;2006 was giving out loans like candy to people who had absolutely no way of ever servicing them&lt;br&gt;this then resulted in a lot of forced selling into a no bid market as all of this inventory was cleared when the bubble popped&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;right now we dont have excessive loans, quite the opposite retards arent given insane loans this is legit existing money bidding up hard assets because so much money got printed and it has to go somewhere&lt;br&gt;you dont get a crash in housing without forced selling and who is going to force sell his real estate at low prices without the bank margin calling them&lt;br&gt;unlike stocks which are completely fungible and its price is set at the margin, housing isnt and the owner can just sit on the asset forever and not be forced to take any offer being made at market price&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;to disrupt this &amp;#x27;bubble&amp;#x27; you need the government unprinting the money supply (lol, lmao even) or you need a large section of boomers dying off and leaving their heirs with no way to pay the taxes/upkeep and force dump it&lt;br&gt;the second one is the only realistic option, tho there is also the risk that the heirs can pay for the inheritance and real estate is now permanently locked up in magnate hands and the nation reduced to permarenting slave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865001&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It really isn&amp;#x27;t mentioned enough that our &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; after 2008 was just setting interest rates to 0 for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865048&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864989&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;...a large section of boomers dying off and leaving their heirs with no way to pay the taxes/upkeep...real estate is now permanently locked up in magnate hands....&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;ve laid out exactly what&amp;#x27;s been going on since 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865068&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865048&lt;br&gt;yes thats the point, the implication here is that real estate is now permanently priced out of the middle class income range&lt;br&gt;not that a crash is imminent like the anon i was replying to seemed to suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865501&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857490&lt;br&gt;I knew it was really over when Wendy&amp;#x27;s and pizza Hut announced theyre closing hundreds of stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865585&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857490&lt;br&gt;Idk these terms, and economics is a fraudulent science anyways, so I&amp;#x27;ll just say what I see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My life sucks.&lt;br&gt;Its getting worse.&lt;br&gt;I am watching generational decline among my family (each new set of kids struggle more than their parents).&lt;br&gt;People seem unhappy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Call that recession, depression, or economic boon! Idc, US is a shithole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m sure people will respond saying I&amp;#x27;m cherry picking. Dishonesty is rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857779&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Foreign money taking investments out of the US because trump is an unpredictable fucking moron being puppeteered by unironically evil people&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;American dollar has lost 10% of its value over the course of 2025&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Constant tariff bullshitery that is objectively hurting American industries that rely on imports&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nuked basedbean deal with China on top of farmers needing a fucking bailout because of the retard they voted in (again)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Tourism industry cratering every day as we speak so even less money being injected into the economy &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ICE operation have caused businesses across the country to shut down because either no one&amp;#x27;s willing to go out, or because they don&amp;#x27;t want random goons in masks harassing employees&lt;br&gt;Dude it&amp;#x27;s actually impressive how hard these retards just destroyed the entire reputation of america abroad and fucked us over domestically, but his cult fan base and circle of wannabe oligarchs who own media outlets will continue telling you that there is no war in ba sing se&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865663&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861063&lt;br&gt;We really need to do what the Chinese do with making sure household consumption as share of GDP is increasing. Actually reflects living standards instead of billions of dollars getting spitswapped between 3-4 different AI companies constantly. Then again, most of the people hear would just ree hearing the term “5 year plan” or “stability focused infrastructure development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865674&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865585&lt;br&gt;MIGAtrannies will happily eat shit if a libtard has to smell their breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865800&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865585&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;US is a shithole&lt;br&gt;and the usa still gives you about the best chance in the world to improve your life if you come from humble beginnings&lt;br&gt;altho it also offers you every temptation possible to make you drive yourself over the financial cliff at every turn at the same time it offers you opportunity&lt;br&gt;just know its far worse everywhere else as society in general is reverting back to medieval style caste based system of neither hope nor escape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865942&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865800&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and the usa still gives you about the best chance in the world to improve your life if you come from humble beginnings&lt;br&gt;this has not been true in at least 20-25 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866035&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865942&lt;br&gt;lol, lmao&lt;br&gt;then give me the list of countries that you think arent just better today but were better 20 years ago and i&amp;#x27;ll have a good laugh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and to clarify we are specifically talking about giving chances to poor unconnected people so dont say retarded shit like liechtenstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865800&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he fell for the meme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866130&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860705&lt;br&gt;None of these are necessary. We could be totally self-sufficient, even for things like rare-earths. The Epstein class decided that would be bad for them so we aren&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866186&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866130&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pharmaceuticals are not necessary &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;input goods for new tech are not necessary &lt;br&gt;Uh huh. So what’s necessary? Shovels, canned food and farmland? If you want to be Amish so badly just do it, nobody is stopping you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the real world, though, self-sufficiency would entail access to pharmaceuticals and the ability to evolve technologically and keep up with the first world. We can sing songs all day about how the US could be self-sufficient one day and that’s fine. The point is that we aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866130&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re retarded if you actually believe this. Even IF we could be self sufficient, and make everything we need ourselves (we can&amp;#x27;t) the price of everything would fucking skyrocket to the point that most people wouldn&amp;#x27;t be able to afford common items that we have now like tvs and phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857508&lt;br&gt;THE DOW IS AT 6 MILLION!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy Coins — 75 replies — 227.3/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849447</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849447?lm=1771352036</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:13:56 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Privacy Coins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849447'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 75 • Updated: 2026-02-17 18:13 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you like it or not, BTC is dying.

Also makes smaller or spontaneous transactions harder unless the governments were to issue gold coins again and that would be bearish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849958&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849447&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;BTC is a pedo coin&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;most used currency for CP is not however&lt;br&gt;quit the infighting, monegro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862582&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849447&lt;br&gt;framing bitcoin as an epstein jewish globalist pedo creation to sabotage it right as it was on the cusp of actually elbowing its way into the world financial system was a masterstroke psyop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862566&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Because I always refute every point nervajeets make. &lt;br&gt;NO ONE MADE ANY POINTS ITT you fucking poo stain bot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;m real, that&amp;#x27;s why I continuously offer you to ask me anything regarding XMR. All of the questions you (in English this can be used both for singular and plural, raj) posted have been answered. I&amp;#x27;m glad you visited the general again and saw that they actually have been answered three years ago already on your favorite platform - reddit.&lt;br&gt;If you have any flaws in XMR&amp;#x27;s you wish to point out let me know, otherwise admit defeat or continue embarrassing yourself publicly.&lt;br&gt;No thanks Alexa, get the fuck of this thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862608&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;NO ONE MADE ANY POINTS ITT you fucking poo stain bot.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The OP pic is interesting no matter how you slice it..&lt;br&gt;Did &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852712 not make any points then? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;If you have any flaws in XMR&amp;#x27;s you wish to point out let me know, otherwise admit defeat or continue embarrassing yourself publicly.&lt;br&gt;Hey, I remember someone saying that!&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;No thanks Alexa, get the fuck of this thread&lt;br&gt;I appreciate your concern but I&amp;#x27;ll continue staying here if you are continuing to smear the only properly functioning crypto currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862698&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861669&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CTRL+F &amp;quot;Nerva&amp;quot;, first person to mention anything about Nerva is the retarded nigger from the Monero threads&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Nervajeets&amp;quot; living rent free lmao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva network hashrate just hit another ATH today.&lt;br&gt;No signs of slowing down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863379&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849447&lt;br&gt;Buy Decred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863975&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863379&lt;br&gt;Irrelevant shitcoin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864393&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862698&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Nervajeets&amp;quot; living rent free lmao&lt;br&gt;No, but I notice patterns, like the smell of cow shit, overuse of the word sir (misspoken as sar) and the incessant need to shill some unmaintained jeet coin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864510&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862698&lt;br&gt;Irrelevant shitcoin #2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864651&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864393&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva sucks as a privacy coin&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva was forked from moneros code&lt;br&gt;You only get to pick one, bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864667&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864651&lt;br&gt;Nice try but having less than 1/3 of our ring size and no mitigations against multiple attacks that worked on our code base (the devs don&amp;#x27;t even know whether their code has the same flaws or not) means it is not sufficient as a privacy coin. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;picrel&lt;br&gt;Next time try something somebody actually said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864677&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849898&lt;br&gt;why would that be bearish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864683&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864677&lt;br&gt;The governments as they are currently don&amp;#x27;t want to embrace our freedom or even anything to our benefit. If they go back to gold coins there will be some catch. If the jew embraces something, try to move as far away from that as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864708&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855597&lt;br&gt;BTCFi is giving it more use cases with Babylon leading the charge. And I think when we have more projects offering native BTC staking, then we will see the narrative go viral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864667&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Try something somebody actually said&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;literally you on every general&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;almost you entirely&lt;br&gt;Cry me some diodes, clanker.&lt;br&gt;Nerva is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864897&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva is here to stay.&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t care if it stays as long as you stop smearing XMR and spamming our threads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864948&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864897&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I don&amp;#x27;t care if it stays as long as you stop smearing XMR and spamming our threads&lt;br&gt;The only spammer is you, in both this thread and the xmr general. You came here to start shit and have done so in every privacy thread that has popped up. You also accuse everyone of being a poojeet and promoting nerva. Again, the only person promoting (xmr in your case) and causing a stink has been YOU. So fuck off back to your little monero hole, jeetbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864948&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The only spammer is you,&lt;br&gt;I wish that were true but sadly the nervajeets constantly try to shit up our thread and this board. There&amp;#x27;s a reason all of these anti-Monero threads pop up when they lose the discussion in the general. Notice how quiet they&amp;#x27;ve become after &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860646 was posted. All of their anti-Monero arguments (which was the entire value proposition for nerva) are gone. Their questions they claim never were answered poofed up into air. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You came here to start shit&lt;br&gt;OP literally accuses XMR of being some freemason bullshit. You&amp;#x27;re the perfect representation of the jew asking what harm he has done to us. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You also accuse everyone of being a poojeet and promoting nerva.&lt;br&gt;No, I say that the ones that copy all of the points the nervajeets make to be a nervajeets. That&amp;#x27;s because the only people interested in nerva are jeets.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Please don&amp;#x27;t challenge me when I smear the only functional crypto currency please just go away I can&amp;#x27;t handle it please please please&lt;br&gt;No sar, you wish to talk about XMR? I&amp;#x27;ll be there and refute each on of your pathetic claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865124&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864651&lt;br&gt;Holy shit, XMR to a fucking T anon...&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865014&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;bot programmed to hate random shitcoin&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;even if not true, makes it look like hes funded by masons/jews because he literally cannot stop promoting monero&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;becomes a meme in and of himself here&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he seriously cant stop&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he will bring nerva up in random threads every chance he gets even when no one is talking about it&lt;br&gt;Just fucking stop and go away monegro. Maybe they didnt stop after that was posted, because they were never spamming up your threads in the first place you pathetic fucking loser. Only you were, they were just asking questions, something anyone can do. I scoured your xmr generals, and your clearly the psychopath across every fucking one. Non stop blogposts of text that do nothing but go in circles, and now youre doing it here. Save yourself some time and go shit up someone elses thread. Oh right, you cant, because youre a monegro botnet that works for monero glowies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started this thread to discuss privacy coins and all youve done is shit up my thread you piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865161&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865014&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;bot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865268&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862698&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865161&lt;br&gt;good morning nervasaaars&lt;br&gt;truly xnv is the most aryan bharatoken superior peer-to-poop privacy coin xnvsaars redeem asap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865268&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;i cant stop sucking monero dick, am i gay enough yet?

I got the screenshot someone snapped of it off the discord. No way a thread gets bumped off this board that fast. There is shit on here for days that no one replies to. Mods are afraid of it. Idk why. Glowies or bagholders probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866158&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865869&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This thread has been pruned or deleted &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865998&lt;br&gt;How do you know that it wasn&amp;#x27;t deleted by the OP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866337&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865998&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;discord&lt;br&gt;very true sar discord is perfect for our poo privacy coin, better stay there, 4chan is an anti-indian glowie honeypot benchod site&lt;br&gt;btw ser remember to send your designated face scan/ID to discord for better compliance nervasaars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866373&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866158&lt;br&gt;Well for one, that thread was only posted a few hours ago. Threads dont die that quick. The other reason is because his thread is back&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865946 and hes asking why his shit got deleted. Oh and 4chan is now blocking me. Yet the mods and XMR fags are the ones who started all this. Ask about nerva, get banned. Buy the JDIF coin goy. Maximumkekles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;btw since my block, they deleted his thread again.

They all had generational wealth behind them, and they all operated on insane levels of exploitation to generate that wealth. Realized that &amp;quot;making it&amp;quot; means screwing over so many people that you alienate yourself from most people, except the likes of musk, epstein, trump, etc.&lt;br&gt;I realized that though the club was small and that I wasn&amp;#x27;t in it, that the people in the club were not the kind of person I wanted to be. I&amp;#x27;d rather disband the club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865646&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865611&lt;br&gt;Nope, I’m out - fuck this third world country in disguise. The problem is thresholds were crossed and stupid people who shouldn’t have power drag you into shit that doesn’t even matter. This whole entire country is rotten, the corrupt local cop is just an extended phenotype of the so called “elite”. Shut off the news, delete all media and just get up and fucking go. Don’t lift a finger for this surveillance prison social credit score algorithm hellscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865657&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Beautifully put.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865437&lt;br&gt;Ok Alesteir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865901&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863924&lt;br&gt;Yes those entities actually exist. In history, people were religious because they were uneducated and most couldn&amp;#x27;t read. now people can read and are educated, but they aren&amp;#x27;t religious, but they also told that spiritual or religious hoo-hah is bull, the only thing that exists is what you see in front of you with your basic senses blah blah. When in fact, people should be using their educated brain to dig deeper. but it&amp;#x27;s all by design by the elites to continue obscuring the truths. they did it hundreds of years ago, and they continue to do it today just in a different way. READ THINGS. start with the bible. answers for a lot of things are in there. you don&amp;#x27;t need to be religious to read the bible and think critically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;then move upwards throughout history and you&amp;#x27;ll notice the pattern. these people are extremely, extremely religious/spiritual themselves. They are Yahwists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865913&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864842&lt;br&gt;Because the chinks are all retarded insects, its not supposed to be driven on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>&gt;mom yells at me for not having a job 5 months after I got laid off from my last one &gt;Complains how we need more money t… — 40 replies — 21.3/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863594</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863594?lm=1771346471</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:41:11 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&amp;gt;mom yells at me for not having a job 5 months after I got laid off from my last one &amp;gt;Complains how we need more money t…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863594'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 40 • Updated: 2026-02-17 16:41 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;mom yells at me for not having a job 5 months after I got laid off from my last one&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Complains how we need more money to pay the bills and how she can&amp;#x27;t keep working 10 hour shifts to pay our bills&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Look through her purse when she&amp;#x27;s not looking &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;See a $600 receipt for perfume and makeup, and a bank note evidencing a $1800 transfer to her neet sister who also has 2 neet sons and a neet daughter. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Dad gambled away another $10K in stocks. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;He keeps sending me job openings in other states/cities that require 10+ years of experience and he tells me &amp;quot;just walk up to them and ask them to train you, that&amp;#x27;s how we did it back in the old days&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;My own savings are slowly dwindling and I&amp;#x27;ve got no more than a few months left before I&amp;#x27;m officially broke &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;800+ job apps and nothing yet&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not sure how much more of this I can take bros...&lt;br&gt;Why won&amp;#x27;t the economy get better? &lt;br&gt;Who do I blame for this miserable situation?&lt;br&gt;What are some easy painless ways to check out of this economy earlier don&amp;#x27;t speak?&lt;br&gt;Why are old people all so stupid and contemptible?&lt;br&gt;NGMI?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863604&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Who do I blame for this miserable situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863605&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;See a $600 receipt for perfume and makeup&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;a bank note evidencing a $1800 transfer to&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Dad gambled away another $10K in stocks&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Complains how we need more money to pay the bills &lt;br&gt;what came first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863607&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;Meant to say, So to speak, not don&amp;#x27;t speak &lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s been almost a few decades of smartphone development and auto correct still doesn&amp;#x27;t work properly yet AI fags are still like &amp;quot;we&amp;#x27;re totally gonna get agi and self driving cars this year bro!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863782&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863651&lt;br&gt;NTA but I was medically disqualified after an injury helping a relative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863786&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join ICE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863791&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863651&lt;br&gt;Most active duty army tried to join a different branch first (bar combat arms), but couldn&amp;#x27;t due to various reasons.

Turns out no one will just &amp;#x27;let&amp;#x27; you be useful to society while making 150k a year working 80 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863856&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863822&lt;br&gt;He&amp;#x27;s just gonna tell you you&amp;#x27;re a loser and to get an apartment with a crackhead roommate or something. Your parents are the problem for not hooking you up with a year of rent and a job if they don&amp;#x27;t want you around. American parents deserve everything coming to them for stealing from their own kids. Who the fuck thinks they can just peace out and retire when society is collapsing lmao. Anyone who says &amp;quot;not my problem, I&amp;#x27;ll be dead by the time it gets REAL bad&amp;quot; is a person I conside rit my duty to cause as much suffering as posible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds like your whole family is dead weight except your mom. The perfume and makeup is probably a desperate move to hopefully find a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863922&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863856&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Anyone who says &amp;quot;not my problem, I&amp;#x27;ll be dead by the time it gets REAL bad&amp;quot; is a person I conside rit my duty to cause as much suffering as posible for.&lt;br&gt;They&amp;#x27;ll all be abused by Indians in the retirement home while their actual children are estranged.

Sounds like your family is financially abusive to you. Can you move out on your own (as soon as you find a job, I mean) and cut contact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863822&lt;br&gt;It really isn&amp;#x27;t. You can live VERY cheaply in a lot of Asian countries (Thailand, Laos, Indonesia) and do ridiculously low-paying remote work and still come out with net savings every month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I worked in Taiwan (DON&amp;#x27;T GO THERE) for a while and was able to save over 50% of my pay even though I made half as much as an American would make doing the same job (not ESLosering).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wish I hadn&amp;#x27;t because it completely destroyed my health permanently (they&amp;#x27;re just as bad, maybe worse, about dumping toxic industrial chemicals in food as the mainland chinsects), but it was the only thing available to me after the 2008-12 crash during the Obamaconomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;corner your dad and mom about that 600+1.8k+10k$. That&amp;#x27;ll make them shut for another 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864358&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;neet sister who also has 2 neet sons and a neet daughter.&lt;br&gt;nigga how old are you? &lt;br&gt;or are you calling infants neets kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864379&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;What the fuck does your retarded family have to do with the economy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864420&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864358&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;her neet sister&lt;br&gt;His aunt is the neet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864425&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863648&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863643&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;just go get killed for ZOG!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only military worth joining is the russian one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864222&lt;br&gt;These are classic case narcissists or sociopaths. They’ll become affronted, say something along the lines of ‘none of your business’ and if they are reticent then it would most certainly be for lip service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864434&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864425&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;just go get killed for ZOG (east)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864449&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863643&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863648&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863852&lt;br&gt;Wow the sõyjack party leaks were true this place is infested with glowies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864425&lt;br&gt;come on dude&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864740&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864358&lt;br&gt;My neet aunts children are in there fucking 40s and never worked jobs yet live like kings.

It&amp;#x27;s comical how everyday my dad cusses her out and yells at her calling her a dumb bitch at the top of his lungs and she&amp;#x27;ll dutifully have dinner ready for him in an hour while washing all his clothes for him yet she&amp;#x27;ll scold me for not cooking my own food even though I never asked her to cook for me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864768&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;He keeps sending me job openings in other states/cities that require 10+ years of experience and he tells me &amp;quot;just walk up to them and ask them to train you, that&amp;#x27;s how we did it back in the old days&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;my dad used to do this&lt;br&gt;holy shit it pissed the fuck out of me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864763&lt;br&gt;She loves getting beat?&lt;br&gt;Huh&lt;br&gt;Wonder if she’d love getting her pussy beat into smithereens.

Meanwhile Europe is in a bull market. You need to pick the right ETFs and stocks though. Best ask Gemini. I&amp;#x27;m big on Siemens Energy and country index ETFs like UK, Poland, Italy, Greece, etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861932&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s literally nothing good about the EU for finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861959&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m european and the shift from my childhood is just immense. Back then most of the music would be american, most of film and television, most video games ect. Nowdays there aren’t any big trends coming from USA anymore, nobody cares about american pop culture and it just feels mild and old fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861959&lt;br&gt;American pop culture is dogshit now. The US used to be where all the cool movies came from, now it&amp;#x27;s all slop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862063&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861986&lt;br&gt;Yeah the last time american culture was cool was in like 2011 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862081&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;Europe is a joke dude. Putting a bunch of dead civilizations into the same economic zone, salting it with Muslims, and picking a fight with both Russia and the US doesn’t look great. They don’t produce much, spend like crazy, don’t reproduce, and are filled with leftists and degenerates. In 50 years it’ll be an Islamic caliphate. You’re better off looking elsewhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862094&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862081&lt;br&gt;Lmao you’re talking like different european countries are different ancient civilizations. You have no idea what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862531&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861959&lt;br&gt;American here, our music is all spics and our movies are all gay niggers, good job avoiding our jew exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862556&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;The only good EU stock rn is defense, but I wouldn&amp;#x27;t hold it for long, all their talk of doing this and that is already falling apart because they can&amp;#x27;t agree whose falling industry gets the most gibs to build their supposedly military hardware, 100% they will quietly cancel everything in a year or two as nobody notices, other than that there&amp;#x27;s literally no companies worth it at all there, not even euros put money there they put all in the us and keep doing despite whatever hostility they may feel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862568&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;You should&amp;#x27;ve already had international stocks years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862602&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;follow numbers not narratives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862640&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The money sure did. My Euro etfs saved my portfolio last year. Keep in mind pic related is not including a 11% apy dividend so the total 1year return was 33% vs the S&amp;amp;P500 which only returned 11% in that same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862653&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861920&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;a crab market since Oct&lt;br&gt;Oh no, NVDA hasn&amp;#x27;t gone up another trillion in 4 months, it&amp;#x27;s all over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865879&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;invest in Eastern Poland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865999&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Are people really shifting to the EU? &lt;br&gt;Nope.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I keep seeing more and more threads focussed on EU biz? &lt;br&gt;k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;focussed&lt;br&gt;Do not redeem saar.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Did Trump really fuck the US economy that much? &lt;br&gt;Nope.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Should i start investing in Europe too?&lt;br&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t care.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t.asian biz bro&lt;br&gt;Quit reading right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866095&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;I mean I straight up lose money investing in the US as long as the Dollar is that weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866142&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;there&amp;#x27;s some great ideas in here. you guys should do that stuff if you really believe in yourselves, I believe in you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I made 30k in a Day — 7 replies — 15.7/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61865072</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61865072?lm=1771351616</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:06:56 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;I made 30k in a Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61865072'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 7 • Updated: 2026-02-17 18:06 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;it was enough&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;find out about RAM bubble&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have dozens of servers for homelab&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;make meme eBay listing&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;sell 6TB of RAM for $30k after taxes and fees&lt;br&gt;Same sticks sold for double at the time&lt;br&gt;Same sticks now 70% less per stick&lt;br&gt;I saw the bubble and did a flip off the top into profit&lt;br&gt;Once the payment cleared I quit my jerb&lt;br&gt;Been making more per day not working&lt;br&gt;2026 is van life friendly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865094&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should i sell my 4060 rtx?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865094&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Should i sell my 4060 rtx?&lt;br&gt;NvidiAI is bleeding money on AI and going to restart consumer GPU production soon&lt;br&gt;so, yes&lt;br&gt;I am currently in the process of selling ALL my Nvidia GPU&amp;#x27;s&lt;br&gt;From professional cards to 40 series&lt;br&gt;already bought AMD replacements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865873&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865072&lt;br&gt;But RAM prices are still at ATH?....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865929&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865873&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;But RAM prices are still at ATH?....&lt;br&gt;This, i&amp;#x27;m work at a VAR.

The nederlands are already way overpopulated.

San Francisco lost all sovl because no one who lives there is actually from San Francisco anymore. D.C. is literally a dilapidated nigger den. New York is cool and iconic but is also a lonely hive where everyone is disconnected despite living 10,000 to a city block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think you&amp;#x27;ve been to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859319&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;worst street&lt;br&gt;So you admit that the left-wing billionaires delegate certain streets for the homeless while they live on the nice streets in their high rises, with private security?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862164&lt;br&gt;They delegate entire states for the washed out retards to live in, while even the homeless here in LA have more upward mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862210&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Non-Americans&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Main Character&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Even Once&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861591&lt;br&gt;This. I&amp;#x27;m from DC too, but I left that shithole years ago. Everyone is a bureaucratic suit who aspires to work for the government or some adjacent entity. Sure there might be ethnic diversity, but there is no cultural diversity at all. Quite literally everyone is a libtard. Not to mention the women there are not only busted but also extremely deluded in thinking that they deserve Chads. A DC 10 is a Miami or NYC 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862537&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859324&lt;br&gt;Can confirm, LA is great. Every month I have to remember to not self-dox because retards are talking about what a shithole it is here, and I want to take a photo of my window view showing that it looks exactly the same as the white southern suburb they all fantasize about. Just don&amp;#x27;t live in the poor part of town. That rule applies to every city on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have *real* mexican food for cheap, no bad weather, and as many asian women and big booty latinas as you could ever want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862380&lt;br&gt;D.C. has long been &amp;quot;Hollywood for ugly people.&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s where ugly people go to make it - with their 6 figure bullshit government job.&lt;br&gt;I lived in Fairfax and worked in Arlington - at least I wasn&amp;#x27;t on the nigger side of the Potomac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864233&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;These places are all horrible unless you’re rich or are on a clear path to wealth. I’m convinced the only places left on earth where it’s still possible to safely and comfortably raise a family on a middling firstie income are Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (the Catholic ones in the EU not the orthodox shitholes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864442&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Eastern Europe&lt;br&gt;Can confirm it&amp;#x27;s comfy as fuck here with just a few hundred grand of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864757&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862146&lt;br&gt;Erm but all my favorite movies take place in those cities so they must be the best and most important in America!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864780&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;most of those cities suck ass and are basically open air prisons for white collar wageslaves. people with money &amp;quot;in LA&amp;quot; live on or near the beach. people with money &amp;quot;in DC&amp;quot; live in surrounding areas like bethesda or chevy chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864816&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I enjoy Manhattan and visiting SOCAL but living there would be too much. I lived on in Santa Monica for a year and anytime you&amp;#x27;d want to do something you had to plan around traffic. Not a way to live you entire life.

I always felt weird taking sick days or whatever because all of my coworkers were workaholics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861031&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861025&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;unlimited PTO&amp;quot; means you just get fired without warning if you take time off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861033&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861001&lt;br&gt;Yes, that&amp;#x27;s basically it&lt;br&gt;Blame every single policymaker and adherent to &amp;quot;multiculturalism.&amp;quot; Many cultures on the planet are in no way bad, even sampled within one area, but there are ZERO instances of long term multiculturalism without major strife, war, and civilizational/societal degradation. Homogeneous cultures, planted at the root of the psyche, are the one guaranteed pathway to the success of the human macroorganism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861082&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;The thing that pisses me off about PTO is that I&amp;#x27;m unable to take UPTO. Sure, give me a certain amount of paid days off but if I want to take unpaid days off I should be able to have as many as I want. Fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861082&lt;br&gt;That too. I might not have made a profit while self employed, but these white collar mind games suck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861115&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861082&lt;br&gt;That would mean your job is so expendable that they can allow you to just leave and come back as you please without having any significant impact on business operations. In which case they might as well just replace you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861197&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinly veiled data-mining thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinly vailed ragebait thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OP is/will always be a cuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861198&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;If you signed, it&amp;#x27;s your fault anon. Next time be ready to do a 360 on the spot if you don&amp;#x27;t like the contract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861502&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861115&lt;br&gt;Kind of, but also not really...I work in admin in the life insurance &amp;amp; personal finance industry, if I&amp;#x27;ve shown myself to be dependable come crunch time, am able to develop processes to make sure cases are compliant, basically keep shit in order, it&amp;#x27;s way more expensive to attempt to hire new and retrain (not to mention re-certify new hires if they come in unlicensed) and re-vet potential new hires. Just because I do all this doesn&amp;#x27;t mean I shouldn&amp;#x27;t be able to take as much time off as I want when it&amp;#x27;s a slow period, or I&amp;#x27;m able to find someone else to cover while I&amp;#x27;m away, you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;Yeah I had to work for 2 years with no days off to earn enough PTO to take two weeks off at one job. If you called in they took a PTO day away and gave you a point. 7 points and it was automatic termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;earn means time in this case&lt;br&gt;this is so you can&amp;#x27;t take you 5 weeks on day one and then quit after that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863592&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861502&lt;br&gt;No, exactly really. If you&amp;#x27;re completely optional, then you&amp;#x27;re completely unneeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864938&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;youd be surprised at how badly niggers abuserd the system in large corpos so they cracked down. &lt;br&gt;Just another perk of life ruined by fucking niggers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864971&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I get 28 days off guaranteed every year and nobody &amp;quot;abuses&amp;quot; the system, lmao mutts will suck cock and say its le efficient or fair I hope your cancer country gets nuked cya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865006&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;Just say you have covid and complications with COVID. Buy an old positive test, go to the doctor and get a note. Boom your off for a few days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865036&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Now I&amp;#x27;m going into this new corporate job and they&amp;#x27;re saying I have to earn my vacations? And earn my holidays? Wtf is this shit. How giving fast do I earn these good boy vacation days. THIS IS FUCKING RETARDED&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loads of jobs have people show up and quit or suck ass and need to be fired. Handing people five weeks they can take day 1 on the job is silly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So instead they&amp;#x27;ll make you work X months and then only award 1 day per 2 weeks or whatever. You still earn 5 weeks off a year but then you just haven&amp;#x27;t gotten it all to blow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865426&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started taking an hour of leave every day because i couldnt do 9 hours a day in the office and wanted to go to the gym before it was pitch dark outside and i got called in by my 3 supervisors and HR and counselling asking if i was suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865735&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865426&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;i got called in by my 3 supervisors and HR and counselling asking if i was suicidal&lt;br&gt;This is how you get mental health leave lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865865&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860903&lt;br&gt;To compete with Jeets and Machines, you must become a Jeet Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
