You&amp;#x27;re a small fish in the biggest fucking pond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you were making it you wouldn&amp;#x27;t deal with ANY of this shit&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Oh my heck the freakin homeless have PILLOWS and BLANKETS &lt;br&gt;Literally who gives a single actual fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872859&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872828&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872853&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;getting AIDS from stepping on a needle is just part of the HUSTLE AND BUSTLE&lt;br&gt;citycels are pathetic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873913&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873895&lt;br&gt;the streets are pretty disgusting after a month of frozen snow finally melting im excited for the rain tomorrow &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873906&lt;br&gt;times square is a shithole thoughever&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its like me saying all of france is marseilles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873926&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873892&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;or at best making $60,000 a year in a place where meals still cost $14-20 and gas is still $3 a gallon and his rent is still retarded high like $1800-2400/mo because nyc/la/boston set rental pricing for the rest of the country&lt;br&gt;Fucking trvke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I live in Ohio making ~62k a year gross and gas prices are $2.90-$4.00 depending on the octane level you need, a meal is $25, a drink at a bar is $15, and rent in the ghetto is $1000-1200 for a studio, or $1500+ if you don&amp;#x27;t want to get shot. On top of that my health insurance is $200 a month, my car insurance is $100 a month, and there are a million other expenses that don&amp;#x27;t get cheaper because I live here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving to a major west or east coast city would cost me MAYBE $1500 a month in additional expenses, but I would make that all back in increased salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873906&lt;br&gt;Oh and people we’re unironically like 75% brown. Any european big city will have by default by population alone more attractive white women. USA has truly fallen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873913&lt;br&gt;I thought my hotel was in some shithole area until i found it was literally at the ”good part of the city” at upper west side. Didn’t matter, the whole place is full of homeless with decayed infrastructure if we don’t count the skyscrapers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874025&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873983&lt;br&gt;anywhere near nycha public housing (x houses like fredrick douglass houses which you were probably close to) or methadone clinics (8th ave between 32nd to 44th street) will be shitty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;every euro visits midtown when really you should be visiting the lower east side and upper brooklyn, midtown manhattan is all commercial office buildings. upper manhattan is rich jews in million dollar penthouses and museums/central park getting shittier the further you go up (the old joke was white people would all get off at 96th st)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i will give you nyc women are fucking ugly, its something in the water. i think florida unironically has better looking women by a few points. montreal has the best looking women in north america. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;marseilles was bad enough that i cannot take euros seriously when they complain about america&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874253&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;The trick is to cost of life max&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want to best ratio income:cost of life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking into account other variables such as opportunities (i guess NY have plenty), quality of life (kek), social life, proximity to family etc&lt;br&gt;And of course taxes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real cheat code being to remote from a shithole with a fat 6 fig, but I personally don&amp;#x27;t feel like fucking whores in Pattaya and have my passport in a safe. But there&amp;#x27;s layers to it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway please stay in NY don&amp;#x27;t come to my cuntry making real estate too expensive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874263&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Never been but I’ve been to Shitcago many times and it always smells like raw sewage it makes me sick. And the fucking people are everywhere. I start to feel mentally ill after a few hours there. I couldn’t imagine living there. Everyone who lives in a big city is absolutely 100% mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;chud can&amp;#x27;t handle the best city in the world &lt;br&gt;Go back to whatever white trash trailer park you came from lil bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874607&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874586&lt;br&gt;Eh european cities beat it in party scene, chicks, safety and lack of homeless. It was maybe the best city in the world in 80s but unless you really like skyscrapers, it’s just a normal third world city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874647&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;I make 36$/hr as a tradie and live in Queens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building my own business, because I live paycheck to paycheck. And I do not live lavishly at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;your constantly walking over human shit, broken bottles or dime bags&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So do the homeless just squat down and shit on the sidewalk in broad daylight? I&amp;#x27;m guessing some of it is dog shit as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve lived in Philly and didn&amp;#x27;t really see actual human feces that commonly, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874674&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872934&lt;br&gt;This is absolutely true. Since I moved here a year ago I’ve had sex with maybe 50-60 women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874766&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873983&lt;br&gt;The subhuman brownoids everywhere is disgusting though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hate grabbing the train and being the only White face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874772&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;i like nyc&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pink id&lt;br&gt;ngmi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874780&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;then move, dumbass&lt;br&gt;get a new job and head the fuck out&lt;br&gt;tell your next employer you&amp;#x27;d take a 30% pay cut (to move to an area with half the CoL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874781&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went as a german student once with my class&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;saw a black women smoke crack at her porch&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;friend fought with a mix tape scammer over one dollar at time square&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;my teacher asked a person, who just snorted a gram coke at the public transit, for directions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;haha you think that&amp;#x27;s bad, just wait til you get a load of the property taxes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874874&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874850&lt;br&gt;this in baltimore it&amp;#x27;s $10k/year in property taxes to live in a dilapidated rowhome from 1910. cities are a meme since 1960 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874884&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;i don&amp;#x27;t think i would live there even if you gave me a free house. even if it wasn&amp;#x27;t a shithole, just the taxes and bullshit would cost more than rent in most places.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874586&lt;br&gt;kys nigger homo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874916&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874874&lt;br&gt;Is this real?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874971&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872853&lt;br&gt;Yeah i was wondering about how the rich people live there. Do they just stay in their small private rich people cuck zones and take the cab everywhere? Why would anyone want to live like that? Why live in a city if you can only actually inhabit small parts of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874993&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872905&lt;br&gt;Yeah seeing kids just walking around amids the violent homeless was crazy. People in europe never have to tolerate something like that with the city of marseilles being the only exception i guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874996&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874586&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Roach likes to live in the infestation&lt;br&gt;Kys faggitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874916&lt;br&gt;his fetal alcohol syndome is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876553&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;live in Iowa&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;don&amp;#x27;t have to deal with any of this&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pay $930 for a cozy one bedroom apt&lt;br&gt;just move bruh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;isn&amp;#x27;t NY like really cold and full of snow right now? How are the homeless sleeping with pillows on sidewalks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876559&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;why would anyone live here&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;proceeds to live there &lt;br&gt;It’s because it’s a faggot containment zone. Also didn’t read your blog post, fuck off and learn to be concise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876565&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874874&lt;br&gt;this has to be fake, how does he look so young?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876584&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember the days I visited NYC, DC, LA, and San Diego vividly because they were my least favorite days wow what a waste of time, effort, nerve and money. Absolute third world shitholes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876592&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Jew York is an huge pile of shit, move away as fast you can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876642&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874971&lt;br&gt;Rich people live in huge estates outside of the city while delegating to CEOs in the cities filled with wageslaves to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake and Gay Economy — 44 replies — 31.2/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520?lm=1771550794</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 01:26:34 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Fake and Gay Economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 44 • Updated: 2026-02-20 01:26 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will this gay as economy finally collapse and how can i profit from it?&lt;br&gt;Its ridiculous the woman at our workplace contribute nothing to the company and make more money than i do&lt;br&gt;Its infuriating we just had a bunch of lay offs and we lost some of oir best workers but somehow a bunch of HR shits who do nothing all day still work here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HR is a necessary function, chud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871530&lt;br&gt;For what?&lt;br&gt;Genuinely why do we need it to this extent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Protect the corp from lawsuits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;This is a fiat problem, not a capitalism problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872170&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;The purpose of HR is to protect the company. Putting a retarded and narcisstic Stacy in and having her railroad, gaslight, and demoralize employees, is her primary objective. Think of it as internal forced arbitration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872188&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872072&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ai will replace the hr roastie&lt;br&gt;yes&lt;br&gt;but then she will just be hired to do something even more worthless&lt;br&gt;that will pay even more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872195&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s because they decide whom to fire. Make the lists, at least, which then get approved without looking. Do you think they&amp;#x27;d put themselves on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872202&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;For once, all of picrelated feet don&amp;#x27;t look like they smell so good. God I hate HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872233&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;capitalist&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;where the corporations control the government&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and steal all the the money via bail outs and money printing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thats not capitalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872278&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Government prints money to give it corporations so they can just give it to each other in a circle to make number go up&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Corporations just use that imaginary money to buy back their own stocks to artificially make number go up&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;80 billion dollars given to Israel so all Israeli citizens are guaranteed healthcare and higher education and six figure stipends while you are denied this in your own country&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Capitalism&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872395&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872072&lt;br&gt;You couldn&amp;#x27;t be more wrong.

I instantly know there is a schizo take coming when i read this. Some schizo takes are interesting, some are even good, some are good to think through and some are just funny to read. But they stzill are schizo takes and mostly bullshit influeces too much by wish bias. So how and where did this phrase pick up with schizos. When i know, its around 2021/2022 when the schizo&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;economy will collapse and people will starve due to lockdowns&lt;br&gt;did not materialize. Then they started with this phrase to somehow save their prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873806&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no less than three seething replies about muh real capitalism&lt;br&gt;If you abolished the state it would be reinvented by the wealthy overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;Fake and gay was in use when I 1st started using this site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873988&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Hopefully never because I have a fake overpaid job, just not in HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876439&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872064&lt;br&gt;And prevent White women from breeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>STOP BUYING THE FUCKING DIP — 7 replies — 28.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875225</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875225?lm=1771555058</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:37:38 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;STOP BUYING THE FUCKING DIP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875225'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 7 • Updated: 2026-02-20 02:37 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHICH FAGGOTS KEEP DOING THIS I WANNA SPIT AT THEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875227&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875225&lt;br&gt;Every pullback is an opportunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875228&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875225&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;mfw looking at all the cheapies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875241&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875225&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;m Eric Trump and I bought the dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875300&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875225&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s literally just Saylor.

Foreign stocks are beating the everloving fuck out of US stocks this year so for for example.&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s why he said global ETF&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;honestly abusing correlation seems only worth it if the assets have an equal return to stocks, all this junk has such low return even if its negatively correlated you&amp;#x27;re not going to get a free reduction in variance with it without killing your return. That&amp;#x27;s why i heard some paper showed its optimal to just go 100% stocks. Even if your a boomer, bonds aren&amp;#x27;t really worth it, you can just adjust your spending if theres a downturn and still come out ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying to finds stocks/etfs that are weakly correlated seems to be the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872998&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872888&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of assets that meet or beat equity markets with CAGR and are low correlation. Some are right in the data here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872698&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gold for example has a higher average annual return, better risk adjusted return, and a 0.1 correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;All on btc shorts. Outperform those gay indexes for the next three years in one week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;Why do you focus on yield so much instead of total returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a lot of US large cap equity exposure with tax inefficiency if it&amp;#x27;s in a taxable account. You&amp;#x27;ll get big dividend though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like PTY, ASGI, etc for yield personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873145&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872998&lt;br&gt;no it fucking doesn&amp;#x27;t, in the last 110 years it has returned 5% while the stock market returned 10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873145&lt;br&gt;ik this is probably bait but that&amp;#x27;s a very silly time period to look at because before we got off the gold standard it was fixed ounces/USD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaning 0% growth for half that period dragging the CAGR way down lol. Doesn&amp;#x27;t make sense to look at the return pre Nixon shock for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;if you like uncorrelated risk adjusted-returns you should look at alternative investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;Returns are totally dependent on the managers imho, it&amp;#x27;s a cool class. I&amp;#x27;m not a huge fan of the illiquidity personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do like some of them them, especially private farmland/timberland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not a huge fan of venture or growth PE, guess I&amp;#x27;m lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873207&lt;br&gt;have you looked into managed futures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873080&lt;br&gt;I use my brokerage as my main savings account. Instead of getting $500/month in a high yield savings account I rather get $1400, 50-75% I could reinvest. But since you do this for a living I&amp;#x27;m going to listen and allocate more money for growth rather than yield going forward, and you&amp;#x27;re right about the taxes, I didn&amp;#x27;t think too much about that. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873214&lt;br&gt;I cant believe I forgot about those!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use the ETFs for simplicity. ISMF/CTA for crisis alpha. I almost went DBMF too, but I prefer the purer systematic trend heavy ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you have any strong opinions on them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like extreme negative correlation, like -0.4 with 6-8% CAGR which is completely acceptable if you&amp;#x27;re rebalancing with a really aggressive equity portfolio. I considered pairing them with TQQQ or SOXL to be a total jackass at once point and pussed out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873231&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873220&lt;br&gt;You accept more risk (volatility) for those higher returns, that&amp;#x27;s the tradeoff. If you are OK with higher risk then you could always choose one of those balanced allocation funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOR for example just rebalances a 60% stock / 40% bond index portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOA does the same thing but 80% stock (more risk)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These really are the easy button for people that don&amp;#x27;t want to self-manage imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably a good idea to put the portion that&amp;#x27;s your emergency fund into something boring and very lowvol but decent yield. Check out JPST, that might be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873222&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;those are the returns for my managed futures program, im a CTA. its great uncorrelated returns but theres a lot of programs that under perform or blow up (-60%+ years). its definitely more liquid than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873270&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873256&lt;br&gt;Damn dude you&amp;#x27;re crushing it. What&amp;#x27;s the time period on those returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind if I ask what your strategy is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any specific managed futures ETFs you like? Are they even close to replicating the actuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873270&lt;br&gt;thats 20 months of performance trading 8 different futures markets. semi-systematic medium frequency trend following. im not too familiar with the ETFs that track managed futures but they usually focus on the billion dollar CTAs and those programs are lower returns lower risk just trying to be uncorrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873448&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873184&lt;br&gt;ok, its still not beating the stock market unlike your claim, and if you take the last 3 years out and it drops a lot. That is insane volatility that it doesn&amp;#x27;t converge after 50 years. Realistically the actual return is maybe 7% and you get very long periods of dogshit ~3%, and for all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m currently halfway through finishing my CFP course&lt;br&gt;Any advice for someone trying to hit the ground running, beyond spamming LinkedIn? Or should I just accept that this job market is going to rape me until I give up hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Cant ai just do most of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;This. Almost tooka financial advisor job. Then I realized, &amp;quot;why the fuck would anybody talk to a human about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Cause the AI will tell you something plausible that it thinks you want to hear, and it will partially or mostly hallucinate the data it uses to deliver that response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Do you hold any bitcoin? What are your thoughts on it and does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874040&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872561&lt;br&gt;I am a europoor(in a very poor country) so I dont think i have access to most the stuff you are listing. I can only buy ETFs, I have most my portfolio in a Global market cap ETF some in europe ETF and a little in small cap value international and emerging markets. Also bought a sizable stack of silver sub 30 dollars but its going to be a bitch to sell. I dont invest in bonds since I think that every government will just keep on printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874046&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873450&lt;br&gt;Connections are everything, and the exam will be easier than you think. The classes were hugely valuable, were harder and more useful than my master&amp;#x27;s degree courses. Most companies will have you try to peddle shit insurance products to friends/family at the entry level it&amp;#x27;s gross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Maybe someday, not right now. For what &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873827 said and because it just sucks at answering niche or complex questions. When I ask it things it usually feeds me flat out wrong answers that would be passable to someone that didn&amp;#x27;t do any research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example is having it try to pick stocks. Gets obliterated by the index funds every time. It&amp;#x27;s a consistent loser at this because it can&amp;#x27;t make forward projections and the question is too complicated for it. Tax questions are a horror show too, you&amp;#x27;d think it would be good at those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main issue with AI in my eyes is that it just doesn&amp;#x27;t understand humans/human nature. Most of my job is behavioral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;I do, I made a bunch of money in it 2016ish and now build and rebalance a position in my retirement accounts (5-10% allocation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874061&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874040&lt;br&gt;Wish I knew more about EU investing, I&amp;#x27;m completely specialized for US investing so it&amp;#x27;s out of my wheelhouse. I only have a handful of expat/foreign clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EU bonds have been zero or even negative for a long time. I won&amp;#x27;t touch them because they don&amp;#x27;t compensate you for loaning them money, and I can&amp;#x27;t believe people keep buying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently it has something to do with their SIPC insurance equivalent, safer park for cash than a checking account basically because of the federal coverage you get by buying a bond. I haven&amp;#x27;t looked much into it just what I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgot to answer this part. We don&amp;#x27;t buy it in our portfolios, but we do help clients manage the risk associated with it. Some people are believers in crypto so we highlight the risks (volatility, no intrinsic value, etc) and then work with them to figure out how much of their overall investments is a prudent amount to put into that risk asset. I personally cap myself at 10% for both gold and crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto is actually considered speculation instead of investing by most managers. Kind of like commodities/gold/NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874261&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873448&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;its still not beating the stock market &lt;br&gt;It does in the 26-year backward looking period in the data array from the picture by 30bp. Instead of just pulling 7% out of your booty you could spend 10 seconds doing the present value calculation if you really wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s about 9.8% annualized if you go all the way back to &amp;#x27;71 from now ($39-$5,000). That&amp;#x27;s definitely nothing to scoff at when constructing a portfolio and hedging equity markets considering the 0.1 correlation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;That is insane volatility&lt;br&gt;Volatility is good in a portfolio of non-correlated assets that&amp;#x27;s rebalanced outside of tolerance bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market&lt;br&gt;Almost keeps up with it and doesn&amp;#x27;t move in the same direction, which is the idea. Non-correlated assets, rebalancing the volatility, and risk-return tradeoff are portfolio construction 101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874286&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright anon, I&amp;#x27;m out. Have a great day and I hope every one of you gets to retire early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS long nursing homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874295&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Is there a gap in the asset management &amp;amp; financial planning software market? Seems you are just using an excel sheet there. Is there any way your life could be easier or more automated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a developer and I like money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874345&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874295&lt;br&gt;The software is pretty comprehensive and generally way deeper than just an excel sheet, but of course there&amp;#x27;s an industry spectrum of how deep/detailed the analysis goes by firm and by program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some is straight up basically a cash flows projection laid on top of a balance sheet (excel). The people that use this are shitty whole life insurance people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the auxiliary software where the money is at right now it seems. AI that reads trusts using OCR and spits out a summary to help you find issues. Tax software. Stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our software for portfolio management (have used 3) is AWFUL though. That&amp;#x27;s a big gap for asset management imho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876336&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874261&lt;br&gt;Im sorry but your sample size is not big enough. The volatility and nature of the distribution of gold prices (its not normally distributed) means you have to be very careful about inferring information about long term returns. For example if you look at gold as an asset just 5 years ago you get very different conclusions. &lt;br&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo If the data changes heavily based on the precise dates or periods that you choose it indicates it hasn&amp;#x27;t converged to an acceptable error margin yet. 7% is a guess at what an average random sample period would be given that they can range from ~3% to ~9% or w/e but idk, im not gonna do your job for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simple sanity check should tell you that an asset that doesn&amp;#x27;t produce or do much of anything shouldn&amp;#x27;t outperform real cash generating businesses and companies in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Microtragedy — 32 replies — 24.3/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873618</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873618?lm=1771551121</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 01:32:01 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Microtragedy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873618'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 32 • Updated: 2026-02-20 01:32 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine DCA&amp;#x27;ing for six years for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873641&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873651&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;Bitcoin is a Dyson mound of cryonetic termites and lived for millions of years on a kinetic crash course with fuck YOU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873656&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;Because he can only buy when people give him money.

It&amp;#x27;s a scheme that allows elite whales to cash out at the top. Fed money goes to Blackrock who buys mstr bonds. Mstr buys Bitcoin OTC from those in &amp;#x27;the club&amp;#x27;&lt;br&gt;There wouldn&amp;#x27;t be enough liquidity otherwise. &lt;br&gt;Noone actually buys mstr it&amp;#x27;s just an Epstein type operation to move money around and the goyim are too dumb to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873851&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saylor is well paid to launder funds through his “Bitcoin” management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875118&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873812&lt;br&gt;If mstr defaulted on those bonds BlackRock is going to be the biggest loser then since &amp;quot;noone actually buys mstr&amp;quot;. But I guess it won&amp;#x27;t hurt BlackRock portofolio if it really dropped to that point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe ~5-10% of mstr shareholders are genuine retail traders I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873670&lt;br&gt;Why aren&amp;#x27;t those bitcoins in his cup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875157&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873658&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;Are the longs cheap or still way overbought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875172&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873658&lt;br&gt;LOL&lt;br&gt;X10 is sure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875219&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;why is the mNAV &amp;gt; 1.0 to begin with? shouldn&amp;#x27;t it be &amp;lt; 1.0 since their value is basically btc_holdings - debt_obligations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;I hope this faggot&amp;#x27;s bluff gets called so bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875246&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;Holy based cyber hornets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the best thing to happen to crypto.

I am also a newly graduated psychiatric nurse practitioner. I was about to start an NP job with a guaranteed salary of 150k with good benefits and a decent RVU bonus (bonuses for how many patients I see). However, this job has incredibly shady business practices, terrible reviews from former employees and was far away from home. The job was in a northern suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. It was three 12 hour shifts in a row without a lunch break. I was supposed to start in early April.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I resigned last night in favor of a job close to family in a rural area in the southeast USA. This job pays me a 6,000$ a month draw and 67% of my collections. After I pay off the draw in a few months I could make as much money as I want, but that is contingent on the amount of patients I see. I can work as much or as little as I want. Take as much lunch break as I want. Benefits are offered W-2, but the health insurance is expensive. Here I will be doing real psychiatry and not corporate slop crap psychiatry. Also, my family is very happy about me staying close to home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically I am trading certain money at a shit job for uncertain money (albeit a higher ceiling) at a good job. I talked to one of the NPs at the new place and he says that he makes about 24,000$ a month before taxes after working for 5 years. This would be almost double what I would have made in Frisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you think I made the right choice? Would you have done the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875728&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;so you took a better job, for higher pay, to live in a lower cost of living area with more flexibility and closer to family?&lt;br&gt;wow, just wow anon. you fucked up big&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875759&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows because every fag online claims he makes 300k a year now. No one knows what a good job is anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875728&lt;br&gt;True, but there is a worst case scenario where I am getting almost no patients and stuck in the draw for much longer than anticipated. Although if I work 5-6 days a week I doubt this will happen. Also, If I somehow get fired while still paying the draw I have to pay it all off in 10 days, which would be nightmare scenario. There is more risk with the good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875905&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875878&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no patients&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in rural shartmerica&lt;br&gt;you will be overloaded with obese diabetic fentanyl-addicted burgeoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875905&lt;br&gt;Well I sure hope so.

It&amp;#x27;s the reason the covid lockdowns happened. They were the only demographic at risk but they had no problem shutting society down and ruining the lives of the youth to prevent themselves from getting a bad cough. We live under boomer communism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876158&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875986&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s what my dad did, so now I get to enjoy his retirement instead. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876242&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875986&lt;br&gt;Truthnuke. The real blackpill is realizing if you&amp;#x27;re born working or middle class you will not work and save your way out towards a comfortable life until you are old, and even then, you gotta basically pray that a big unexpected money sink won&amp;#x27;t happen such as you or a close relative getting very sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your children MIGHT enjoy the fruits of your labor, and they&amp;#x27;ll do it off of your blood and sweat, and that&amp;#x27;s implying you&amp;#x27;re a high-ish IQ person who lands a good job AND invests money wisely over a time frame of 15+ years. Both conditions need to be met. But forget about &amp;quot;enjoying life&amp;quot; yourself unless you get very lucky. You don&amp;#x27;t enjoy shit when you&amp;#x27;re old. The big problem with getting hopeful about saving and investing is people thinking one day as a 50 year old is the same as one day as a 25 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875968&lt;br&gt;You should also put some extra money into that brokerage account. A million isn&amp;#x27;t what it&amp;#x27;s cracked up to be, and it&amp;#x27;ll be even less by the time you&amp;#x27;re 59 1/2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he isn&amp;#x27;t 100% in precious metals by now&lt;br&gt;NGMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876566&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876242&lt;br&gt;Life as a 50-year-old old is identical to 25 except for your have more appreciation for everything.

By significantly increasing the integration of technologies from the Ripple ecosystem, the Frankfurt-based bank aims to fundamentally reform the structures of worldwide money transfers, which are often criticized as outdated. The focus is not only on cross-border payments, but also on the complex foreign exchange business as well as the secure custody of digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873420&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, you can hate and FUD XRP all you want, but Ripple is making huge progress and XRP holders will be rewarded sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873425&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873420&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873412&lt;br&gt;Saaar tumor banks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873453&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873412&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873420&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873425&lt;br&gt;Ripple literally pays banks like Deutsche bank toi announce this bullshit. Nothing is happening.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Während klassische Überweisungen oft mehrere Tage in Anspruch nehmen, verkürzt die neue Infrastruktur diesen Prozess auf wenige Sekunden.&lt;br&gt;No bank transfer still takes days ripple still has the 2012 narrative&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Dies bietet enorme Vorteile für Multi-Währungs-Konten und den globalen Devisenhandel, da Liquidität nun in Echtzeit bereitgestellt werden kann.&lt;br&gt;Complete bullshit word salat this is solved already.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Schätzungen gehen davon aus, dass der Einsatz von Distributed-Ledger-Technologie (DLT) die operativen Kosten im globalen Zahlungsverkehr um bis zu 30 Prozent senken kann.&lt;br&gt;So 30% less costs to transfer&lt;br&gt;And then they talk about the volume of these transfers to have trillions as connection but these are not the transfer costs.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Die Deutsche Bank nutzt nun Blockchain-Lösungen, die durch die Technologie von Ripple angetrieben werden, um diese Reibungsverluste zu eliminieren&lt;br&gt;Read very carefully. Deutsche Bank uses Blockchain. Ripple advances Blockchain technology.

Now a recession means whatever we want it to mean, aka there will never be another recession again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;I voted for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870855&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;2% increase in steel production &lt;br&gt;We’re back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870872&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;1%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They really think you mutts are retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870899&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870872&lt;br&gt;I was being generous kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871327&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869343&lt;br&gt;It won&amp;#x27;t be doomed if the poor wagies keep working like that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872300&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869507&lt;br&gt;I worked 2 full time jobs more then once&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;morning shift at restaurant&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;7am -2pm&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Deliver Pizza&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;4pm--10pm, midnight on Friday&lt;br&gt;Morning shift was Monday- Friday&lt;br&gt;pizza shift was Thursday-Sunday&lt;br&gt;so only 2 days of the week actually sucked ass. Delivering Pizzas though was working with friends and we would smoke pot and drink beers, didn&amp;#x27;t feel like work really.&lt;br&gt;This was in the aftermath of 2008, during 2009/10 I did that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869517&lt;br&gt;3 days a week is not a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872729&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;think&lt;br&gt;*know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872903&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870845&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;defining a recession by the fucking dictionary&lt;br&gt;stupid nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872909&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s been in recession since two thousand fucking eight &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;they just can&amp;#x27;t hide it anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872927&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872563&lt;br&gt;36+ hours is a full time job, retard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874552&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am one of those assholes. But then again, I pull like 290k. Make that paper bitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876139&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;Has nothing to do with making ends meet and everything to do with shitty spending habits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876213&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869507&lt;br&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t forget the people that sign up for two WFH positions and fake their way through both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876310&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876213&lt;br&gt;Stop talking about me. I made a small fortune in the past 5 years doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876386&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;this is insane&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;less than 1% of the population is working more than one full-time position&lt;br&gt;Okay. Personally I&amp;#x27;m interviewing for a second job just because I want more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876391&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870855&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870872&lt;br&gt;Yeah we should be like Obama and just accept that jobs will never return. It takes time to improve things so don&amp;#x27;t ever try, silly goy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876412&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;the cope itt is crazy. it hurts to watch a once-great nation falling apart in denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876435&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;China will take over as world superpower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876558&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;this is like those 5&amp;#x27;11&amp;quot; vs 6&amp;#x27; memes &lt;br&gt;holy shit, they cannot be serious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876562&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;How bad is it if this is the good news damn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
