Nobody will ever love them and I can also make 10 million without displaying my butthole for the world to see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889278&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s only like top1% creators making millions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889279&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;i didnt care too for so long but now im starting to care fml its just so unfair.. Not only are they extremely hot they also get to make 20MM a year for years scamming with bikini pics on OF&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its just so unfair i feel like crying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of them make a couple hundred bucks tops and are too scared to do anything worthwhile. The amount of my normie Co workers that post on feetfinder without showing any goods thinking they&amp;#x27;ll get rich is hilarious. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re fine anon. It&amp;#x27;s no different than someone lucking into an inherence or a small state lotto win. Just remember when you walk into HR, the girl across from you has either tried Onlyfans and most likely failed or knows someone who did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you see your dignity 10 bucks and twelve dairy queen coupons? Because they would&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889284&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;retard women live retard woman experience. you care about money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;OF&lt;br&gt;Literally who?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889292&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Theres literally only been one titty streamer that turned that 5 minute success into owning multiple gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889292&lt;br&gt;Car washes are where the money is at&lt;br&gt; Once you get your bag idk why people keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889301&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889283&lt;br&gt;okay this makes me feel better thanks man&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889304&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bro, these bitches don’t “make” money they just receive donations. There’s just as many if not more girls just receiving money from sugar daddies without an OF. These bitches would be getting money from sugar daddies regardless, instead of 1 or 2 sugar daddies giving them tons and tons of money they have thousands of sugar daddies giving them a little bit of money. If anything they are getting a worse deal from OF. Freedom and independence will never make a woman happy so they have no clue what to do with their lives anyways. It’s just one of the perks of being a woman, you get all your shit paid for. Just like women have access to secretary positions where all it takes is a retard to answer a phone and take messages and reply to emails just because they’re attractive and the bosses want them around. There’s a price on beauty and it’s a very short window to capitalize on. All they have to do is take a few pictures and videos, it could be all in the same day, and those pictures can be rolled out for years so they literally don’t have to do any work and can just let an agency handle everything. Almost all these bitches use an agency so they are giving up almost 50% of the profits to men. So there is an easy way for you to capitalize on these bitches profits you just aren’t doing it. This shit has been going on for centuries. It’s nothing new it’s just online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889315&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are thousands of whores that lose their dignity on OF without making any money at all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889322&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;You know there are criminals, corrupt politicians, and mindless corporate drones making more than that, right? Perhaps you imagine an economy in which people are compensated for the value they provide to society. That&amp;#x27;s only an ideal, not the economy that exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889335&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;I am still a virgin at 35 and over my entire life I have wasted only 2.40 CHF on women. I&amp;#x27;m proud of myself that I&amp;#x27;m not a cuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889339&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;a girl I knew from school started an onlyfans. everyone she grew up with saw her getting fucked. she made like $200 and deleted it a couple months later. I feel like this is probably pretty common&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889347&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889339&lt;br&gt;Is she hot? You gonna share with the class?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889349&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889335&lt;br&gt;Was that 2.40 CHF for a cup of coffee? Bus fare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889354&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889339&lt;br&gt;Girl I knew in the office years ago had hers leaked by one of the bitchy HR ladies. Like 14 people paid 5 bucks to sub to it and watched her rail herself with a 7 inch hog.&lt;br&gt;Eventually it got to her and started impacting her work and she was put on a PIP.&lt;br&gt;She quit like a month later. Think about that. At best she made the equivalent of a few burgs at Wendy&amp;#x27;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889368&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889354&lt;br&gt;You made that up in your head. Why would HR have her porn videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889372&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889347&lt;br&gt;yea she was hot. she was also one of my good friends sisters. i didnt save any of the videos though&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889354&lt;br&gt;yep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889378&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889368&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not really difficult to understand if you understand how women work. Her being HR just happened to be where she worked. Office gossip is unfortunately how office wagies fill their day. Men aren&amp;#x27;t much different desu. We just talk about we railed so and so on the weekend. &lt;br&gt;Office women are vile and will say the most endearing things to your face before finding ways to tell your wife at the Christmas party how she heard you got blown by your manager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889392&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Are they?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rented cars&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;leased jets&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;AirBNBs in Dubai for two days&lt;br&gt;All the illusion of being rich. Even if they did make a few shekels, they are definitely beholden to the pimp that is laundering money through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889405&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;grow boobs then if you don&amp;#x27;t like it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889409&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Barely any of them do, pretty much just the hottest ones that are willing to get their brains fucked out on camera. If you aren&amp;#x27;t one of the hottest guys willing to have your dingle out for the world to see it really isn&amp;#x27;t comparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889409&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an enormous amount of work too when you get big enough to make decent cash but not enough to sustain yourself. Answering 48 messages in the morning yourself because you can&amp;#x27;t afford to pay a guy to do it for and you can&amp;#x27;t not answer because these guys are shelling out 70 percent of your revenue. Then you return. Film more. Do it again and scrape by for maybe 900 bucks a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s almost more worth it to end up being worth a few cheeseburgers so you know you aren&amp;#x27;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889624&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you really cared you would be pimping OF models by now. You think women do anything in their own? They all have pimps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not glamorous but you can go on craigslist whenever you want and make a quick couple hundred getting your dick sucked by lonely old queers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889644&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889631&lt;br&gt;How is that even worth $200? Enjoy your money pox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889769&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;Holy cope. Obviously most men will love them because men are horny dogs. Its 2026, prime time to realize men are the more pathetic gender. This aint the 50s champ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889773&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nobody will ever love them&lt;br&gt;These bitches get BFs all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889775&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;how do you guys cope with the fact that OF egirls are making tens of millions a year?&lt;br&gt;Only the top 1% do, the rest make around few hundred USD or few 20-40USD a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;Lot of them have BFs and lot of them don&amp;#x27;t do porn with other men just sell their nudes but most aren&amp;#x27;t making enough to retire on not by a longshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889777&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;1. They don&amp;#x27;t receive all that money, they are hired under an umbrella corporation, they are just models for hire.&lt;br&gt;2. They are women, they don&amp;#x27;t know how to invest their money (see amouranth, it was her husband who put her in front of the camera, managed her socials and invested her money)&lt;br&gt;3. I can&amp;#x27;t see what you would do with that much money, unless you are hyper-dependent on people doing things for you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;They aren&amp;#x27;t. The vast majority have sold their souls for triple digit profits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889830&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparing yourself to women is one of the first steps on the tranny pipeline lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>When the AI bubble pops and all those GPUs go to BTC you will see a rally like never before. — 10 replies — 40.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889497</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889497?lm=1771835389</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 08:29:49 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;When the AI bubble pops and all those GPUs go to BTC you will see a rally like never before.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889497'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 10 • Updated: 2026-02-23 08:29 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the AI bubble pops and all those GPUs go to BTC you will see a rally like never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889501&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889497&lt;br&gt;ASIC is superior in every way.

Companies lay off workers. Margins expand. Stocks rip. S&amp;amp;P hits 8,000. Everyone celebrates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• But fired workers stop spending. Companies weaken. They buy more AI to cut costs. More layoffs. Less spending. A negative feedback loop with no natural brake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• The top 10% of earners drive 50%+ of all consumer spending. They&amp;#x27;re the ones getting replaced. A $180K product manager ends up driving Uber for $45K. Multiply that across every major city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Ghost GDP emerges - the economy is &amp;quot;growing&amp;quot; on paper, but the money never reaches real people. Productivity is booming. Wages are collapsing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Then it hits housing. $13 trillion in mortgages, all underwritten on one assumption: you keep your job for 30 years. In 2008, the loans were bad on day one. In 2028, the loans were good. The world just changed after they were written.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• S&amp;amp;P crashes 38% from highs. Unemployment hits 10.2%.

They hired way too many people for bullshit jobs and are now cutting back while saying it&amp;#x27;s because of AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of the shit is due to inflation, first from covid supply shocks, then companies trying to squeeze every last dollar they could out of the consumer and now trump tariffs.

Link came within a hair of flipping xrp in January ‘21. We all know that Link is everything Xrp fraudulently claims to be so it makes sense that this chart should flip soon enough. Will it be gradual or violent? Will it flip because xrp crashes or because Link moons? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly where are some places you can use Link as collateral to borrow Xrp to take full advantage of the trade of the century?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889606&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m so tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889622&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;Link is scam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy XRP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889634&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;Xrp is like chainlink if all the nightmares came true: no use case, no revenue, an ipo that formally cuts token holders out of the picture etc.. and we need over a 10x to reach their market cap.

When you account for staking locking up 95% or even more of the circulating supply(350 Mil, the rest are spoken for on nodes already). I suspect by 2026 BTC will only have around 35-40% dominance as well, projects with specific applications will begin to take hold. Oracles, various layer 1&amp;#x27;s that enable Smart contracts, DEFI, decentralized cloud computing, decentralized cloud storage, and probably other things that haven&amp;#x27;t even been conceptualized yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are supposed to see at least 8 Trillion MCAP by 2025 of all crypto according to the experts. Klaus Schwab mentions this in his book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we will see 4-5 Trillion at the peak of the next bullrun easy. That will probably be early to mid 2022. Next peak bull run will probably mid to late 2026 which could easily run 16-20 Trillion MCAP of all crypto. In the scheme of things that is only around 18-25% of the global GDP. Its honestly not that much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now lets say LINK network protocol captures 4 Trillion by 2026 peak bull run. At even 80% staking saturation (70 Million circulating supply) the price is close to 60,000 per LINK, around 57,000. At 15% circulating supply, its 52.5 Million LINK with a 4 Trillion MCAP is 76,000 per LINK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These numbers sound ridiculous at first or to the uniniated but again when you understand what LINK is/does its honestly not. We are buying a share of the fat protocol that will monetize Web 3.0. I mean think if HTTPS would have been monetized. The Internet itself is worth around 19 Trillion and when you add in data accumulated from the &amp;quot;Internet of Things&amp;quot;, it adds a 5-10x multiplier roughly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Internet is more or less 25 years old for the masses as a whole. If there were 350 Million shares circulating, they would be worth just under 54,000 each at its current estimated value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pic related is fun and entertaining but ironically achievable in the time frame suggested&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discuss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888841&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888754&lt;br&gt;Sounds good I hope it’s true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888754&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;now let&amp;#x27;s say that [impossible thing] could happen&lt;br&gt;nice ass though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888854&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1000 EOY&lt;br&gt;It has always been and always will be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889104&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884400&lt;br&gt;kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889172&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61888754&lt;br&gt;mental illness :/ if only we had a place to put you people that did not have internet access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something something it’s like a mental asylum or something and there is a locker or something and you have like the locker code or something but not really and the locker will open in a few years and there’s like heaps of money or something?

Maybe what i need is 5&amp;#x27;3 and an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883760&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883243&lt;br&gt;They got promoted to Chief Diversity, Equity &amp;amp; Inclusion Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883781&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883644&lt;br&gt;You meant to say inclined. You are more inclined. Akin means &amp;quot;similar to&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883784&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882869&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;incel&lt;br&gt;Im so confused as to what that term means, involuntarily celibate? But its not being celibate if your literally having sex. Such a weird term clearly carrying different meaning. What is the point of using a term that literally has no definition to its meaning, you might aswell speak in baby noises at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884146&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;guys, ALL we have to do is called women like this ugly chopped shit to their face as much as possible and they will lose all motivation to live&lt;br&gt;they are SO fragile in that regard.&lt;br&gt;next time you are walking down the street and see some bitch like this just start yelling “YOURE UGLY”&lt;br&gt;they will spend the next week and a half minimum making reddit posts about it and getting their SSRI prescription upped.&lt;br&gt;don’t ever engage with any ideas or thoughts they have. just pick apart their appearance. you look like a fridge and a stick insect at the same time. your fake dyed hair sucks. you have clown makeup on, you must have learned how to do makeup at the circus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884272&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883066&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re saying ceo&amp;#x27;s willingly burn 75% of their money for fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884291&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884272&lt;br&gt;he&amp;#x27;s saying the ceo is a fucking retard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884297&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;I want to shove my cock deep into the first one from behind. Just lift the skirt and blast the pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883784&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884737&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Without HR you could complete the work, banter and build a genuine camaraderie with your common co-worker, but we cant have unions, and its better if you&amp;#x27;re all divided and conquered, here&amp;#x27;s a harpy to make your life hell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884742&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873193&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872087&lt;br&gt;These niggers actually get it. All problems flow downstream from jews controlling the issuance of your (since 1913) fake and gay fiat debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885902&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;You must be over 18 to use this site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886326&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882442&lt;br&gt;Yeah this kind of mega über schizos who believe in fe and no nuke use this phrase holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882442&lt;br&gt;And yes the idea of space is falsifiable you absolute schizo. Satellites wouldn&amp;#x27;t even work without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883784&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Such a weird term clearly carrying different meaning. What is the point of using a term that literally has no definition to its meaning&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s just people overusing words or ideas to oblivion, where they lose all context. It&amp;#x27;s like the worst insult was being called gay way back, then it was subverted (actually gay is cool), then it became retarded, then it got subverted (actually retarded is cool because you&amp;#x27;re not trying), then it become autistic, then it became subverted (actually it&amp;#x27;s interesting to be autistic), now it&amp;#x27;s random baby talk by gen alpha (mog, cortisol spike, chopped, unc, lil bro, frame, aura farming, 67, incel, cuk). Now it&amp;#x27;s being subverted by people overusing the terms even if they don&amp;#x27;t apply to anyone or anything in the context at all. Someone not having sex for a week = incel. Someone having a slightly embarrassing moment (cortisol spike), someone better looking walking past (mogged), doing something that&amp;#x27;s barely good (aura farming), having a strong presence even if it&amp;#x27;s completely autistic and retarded (frame). Or like when old people started wearing skateboard shirts having no clue what it was, or everyone and their dog wearing an off white shirt. People make shit gay eventually, it&amp;#x27;s a universal law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886363&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;work office job (engineer) with way too many women and diversity hire niggers and Indians who do nothing all day&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;get new (white) South African Vice President&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;calls us all together&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in his funny accent tells us he’s an engineer and knows the business and there will be changes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tells us he will cut 20% of the workforce soon&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;everyone is shit scared and the normie femoids start climbing over each other trying to save their useless asses&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;office girlies start spreading rumours about everyone and everything in desperate attempt to make themselves look better&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;don’t give a fuck, I’m a technician and actually make money for the company unlike them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Vice President just observes the shit show and never comments on anything while he feels out the office&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;come in one Monday&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;literally all blacks are gone&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all except the actual useful Indians are gone&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he culled every single female that we all knew had jewish make believe adult daycare jobs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;only kept the old hag secretaries that actually do a great job&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kek, based white nigger. Turns out all it takes is some third world coloniser to clean this woke shit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886555&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;We are not capitalist.&lt;br&gt;We have been Trotskyist since the end of WW2.&lt;br&gt;Having a central bank is plank #5 of the commie manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886576&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884742&lt;br&gt;It was a bit delayed until after 1913.&lt;br&gt;They couldn’t go full fakeconomy immediately, or they would have been shut down.&lt;br&gt;They had to wait and boil the frog slowly, using the occasional crisis as a speed boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t ever interact with HR once I&amp;#x27;m hired until I&amp;#x27;m inevitably fired. From where comes the HR hate? Are they the ones who actually make the decisions to fire us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886684&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;this board is dead as shit holy fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886687&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886684&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the weekend. It picks up when the market is open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886692&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;d fuck all of them. At the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886363&lt;br&gt;Sounds illegal and fake. This is such an obvious thing to do, there must be a reason it doesn&amp;#x27;t actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889346&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not going to collapse... bill gates will grow some cheap bug burgers and psyop all the women to think it&amp;#x27;s healthy and great for the environment... so we can continue feeding billions of women to do nothing but work in an office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889382&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886363&lt;br&gt;How was he able to be able to gauge who&amp;#x27;s useful and who&amp;#x27;s not in such a short period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889387&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889346&lt;br&gt;Also, paying women to do nothing is one of the best birth controls there is. They are incapable of dating down. Sorry, just the messenger. bullshit jobs, especially for women, will never end until picrel collapses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, the jews also don&amp;#x27;t want picrel to collapse because then their banks would go broke. So we&amp;#x27;re stuck in hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Why do people on this board whine piss and moan about having six-figs? — 58 replies — 18.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61883830</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61883830?lm=1771823889</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:18:09 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Why do people on this board whine piss and moan about having six-figs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61883830'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 58 • Updated: 2026-02-23 05:18 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do any of you realize how unbelievably lucky you are compared against most in even 1st-world countries?

Anyways Im at very low 6 figs one slight dump in stocks and Im back to 5 figure hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want out of the wagecage and its not luck when the average person in the US probably buys fast food 10 times a week, goes out to a restuarant once a week at $200 per visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885045&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it called being tongue-and-cheek you stupid fucking retarded fucking nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885049&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885045&lt;br&gt;oops meet to say tongue in cheek but whatever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885051&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884789&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;median household income&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;household&lt;br&gt;Kek they try so hard to giving a realistic number. Show me median individual income, emphasis on median. Don&amp;#x27;t feed me &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; which is easily skewed upwards.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you live in a nation of 100 people&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;1 person makes $1b&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;99 people make $10k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;average houshold size is 10 people&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;median individual income $10k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;median household income $100k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;average individual income ~$10m&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;average household income ~$100m&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885310&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885051&lt;br&gt;by your own math median is just as misleading as mean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885331&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;500k is nothing. If you have this, congrats. You can spend your entire net worth and buy a decent house. Now what? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has to be more than this, op. People who are &amp;quot;doing well&amp;quot; should be able to actually make a change in this world, yet they can barely afford to buy a house. The system is broken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885340&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885331&lt;br&gt;Back in muh day we just gathered sticks of wood and nailed cardboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;The majority of people in first world countries are boomers, they own multiple houses, have had multiple wives, multiple kids, multiple cars, multiple pension plans. I literally have nothing in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885360&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885350&lt;br&gt;Dont go there just stay where you are. When they send their drones china will just hack them and make them crash.

In both median individual and household income the amounts are more accurate than average while median individual income bears the most accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885512&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m about to enter 6 figure hell next week, what am i in for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;My 300k is literally nothing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885562&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885512&lt;br&gt;5 figure hell after trump&amp;#x27;s tariff tirade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885855&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;Lucky? I&amp;#x27;m a fucking wage slave. Having 600k usd means fuck all when houses cost 2 million AUD in Sydney and I&amp;#x27;m 30 years old. I don&amp;#x27;t want to work the rest of my life (I won&amp;#x27;t anyway as AI is about to take me out)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885862&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885512&lt;br&gt;Depends on your age and savings rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885873&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;Nope. Not good enough.&lt;br&gt;Sense of accomplishment is relative. We want to go up in life, not down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s good that I was born when and where I was. It is a good thing. I greatly appreciate being born on a scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885051&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;what is law of large numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885987&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885331&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;muh house&lt;br&gt;Kys retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886585&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885512&lt;br&gt;Obsessively watching your portfolio everyday, and realizing you’re still broke. I eased off the gas and just started spending a little and enjoying life more when I hit 100k. If it’s gonna be another 30 years to retire, I might as well the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885350&lt;br&gt;Wait 50 years and you&amp;#x27;ll be even richer than boomers unless you fuck it up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886704&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885855&lt;br&gt;You can always rope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886984&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;over 500k at 32&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;165k safe public sector income&lt;br&gt;Never gonna make it ;_;&lt;br&gt;Forever angry at myself for buying the chainlink ICO and then selling before it mooned.&lt;br&gt;Shill me your shitcoins and meme stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886984&lt;br&gt;$500k at 32 is a lot. If you simply invest in an index fund you could get 10% per yeat. Doubling every 7 years. You will have $2 million cash by age 46, which is good. Purely through passive investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889285&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889254&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s 7% per year normally, but we are likely entering a decade of stagnation in stocks now after the 2 decade megabull we&amp;#x27;ve had&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884630&lt;br&gt;Meh, I sold 12 BTC for $40 each&lt;br&gt;Now I&amp;#x27;m broke, but debt free and 300 link&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889424&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886984&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;meme stocks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 165k income?

So I&amp;#x27;m looking into buying again, maybe lump sum maybe DCA. What do you think, anons? Some think that the bear market is just starting so maybe it&amp;#x27;s better to wait... but idk, the sentiment seems rather depressed already. Anyone else also accumulating rn or ar you waiting for october? Alts or BTC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880730&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rn&lt;br&gt;Tiktok negrobabble gets your thread filtered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880730&lt;br&gt;You answered tho?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881053&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;all other macro bottoms took several months of crabbing before the markets went up again, we havent done that yet&lt;br&gt;probably better to wait it out and only deploy capital when its clear the trend has shifted&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;like last macro bottom in late 2022, if you waited till conformation you bought at 18k instead of 16k, a marginal difference&lt;br&gt;i&amp;#x27;ll assume that nobody actually nabbed the 60k bottom here for how short it was&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881059&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881053&lt;br&gt;My fear is that the bull run was kinda front runned so what if the bear is also like that, leading to a shorer bear market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881187&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881059&lt;br&gt;very reasonable assumption but again wait for the turn&lt;br&gt;unless you believe the snap back up will be violent, which is hard to do with sentiment this bad&lt;br&gt;even on the fakest V-est of v-dips during corona you had a good while to buy at 4k&lt;br&gt;and like i said you already missed the 60k window&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881266&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been DCAing for that past two months. My instinct tells me this year is going to be really bad for crypto. Lots of crashing, crabbing, doom and gloom. So I&amp;#x27;ll slurp up as much bloody water as I can and hope that in the next few years we either finish collapsing or I&amp;#x27;m incredibly wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;I voted for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883131&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881187&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s not true, pic related is the covid dip. You had a total of 5 days at 5k, then it started a pretty steep recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883135&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881266&lt;br&gt;Pretty much this, except things will probably turn suddenly when CLARITY passes in a month or 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883290&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883135&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Polity is going to make my bag go line up&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;BUY MY BAG NOW&lt;br&gt;no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;btc behaves like a more volatile leveraged spy. I thought the whole idea is crypto being a hedge against fiat and being decentralized. now american companies like mstr and blackrock own huge chunks and the whole crypto movement depends on american regulations. I dont own crypto and I never will. Everyone still being heavily into crypto at this moment must be desperate as fuck otherwise I dont get it. Last 5 years btc couldnt even outperform the s&amp;amp;p lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883384&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883380&lt;br&gt;Everyone being into ponzi asset, including every single ponzi paper in the spx is desperate &lt;br&gt;You can&amp;#x27;t print yourself out of a demographic deflation.

Then we get bust and people will rotate into treasuries and cash, ready to buy the next bottom.

Are you fucking retarded?&lt;br&gt;Yeah I don&amp;#x27;t play chicken with assets, I DCA when there&amp;#x27;s fear and I sell when there&amp;#x27;s greed.&lt;br&gt;Once again, not buying your bags, nigger.&lt;br&gt;Sold my silver @103 as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883782&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883631&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;like AI&lt;br&gt;buying ai here is about the most retarded investment strategy possible&lt;br&gt;ai credit is cracking all over the place and the mag 7 are going to spend 90% of their revenue on capex this year&lt;br&gt;who is left to incinerate trillions of dollars now, we are about to hit the minsky moment on the ai build out&lt;br&gt;considering the regular economy isnt doing too badly might not even be bad for other assets as the retarded overspend on infrastructure build out is curtailed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and also this isnt even touching on the rather hard physical limits that even if they keep exponentially building more datacenters there doesnt exist the electricity surplus to actually turn the things on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The value of a company is based on its ability to split its profits between its owners, aka shareholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is the value of Bitcoin based on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;Brics, Banks and Billionaires only buying one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The value of a company is based on its ability to split its profits between its owners, aka shareholders.&lt;br&gt;lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884025&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;Did crypto ever have life in the first place? When you consider the (((forces))) at play behind normalizing CBDCs and tokenization of everything - the entire crypto concept becomes just another homosexual ponzi used to control people, track their purchases, and control their rates in order to reward the good goyim, and punish the bad. Unbacked digital tokens on a screen never had any value to begin with. Some people still think the jew.s. dollar has value even though it is literally unbacked and printable monopoly game board paper. It&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;VALUE&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; comes from the jew.s. AIPAC government forcing its usage through tyranny and semitic organizations like the FED. Unbacked paper that the state prints could never be an actual wealth instrument, just fake currency for a fake economy in a fake two-party &amp;quot;&amp;quot;democratic&amp;quot;&amp;quot; nation. Press S to spit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885137&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883631&lt;br&gt;What if I am doing the same thing that always worked and expecting the same result too? Buying assets that &amp;quot;have momentum&amp;quot; is just a different way to say you&amp;#x27;re buying tops, it&amp;#x27;s a retarded strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;If you didn&amp;#x27;t make it in 2021 or 2017 you are ngmi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto needs a major flush out reset or its cooked for good this time. I have never been more bearish for the future of crypto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888075&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;If you are buying alts at this point then you are foolish and deserve to die poor. Go all in on BTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881059&lt;br&gt;Alts saw no bull run desu, BTC on the other hand pump over 5X. Its a smart choice to go for BTC in case this will happen again. I see a lot of anons are into staking now and that&amp;#x27;s a good sign for long term holding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889468&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s the chart of the tulip bubble. Hope it helps you bros out. Unfortunately, unlike tulips which grow on solar power and have their own solar cells, your Bitsteins need electricity too, which of course is not distributed.

Now a lot of middle eastern allies are coming out of the woodwork opposing an invasion.

Maybe it&amp;#x27;s nothing, maybe it&amp;#x27;s going to be devastating in the future. We just don&amp;#x27;t know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887853&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly I like this shit. And I made money on it last year buying in hard at 5 cents and holding until 12 cents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tech is good - it’s magic to watch hard wallet confirmations happen instantly. The chart still looks painful though, but I’m actively considering starting to acquire again. It’s a spiffy first party wallet to be honest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any word on level 2 shit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887873&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61887799&lt;br&gt;Yonatan here, this is misleading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaspa supports archival nodes and pruned nodes. Bitcoin, Ethereum and most modern Blockchain also prune.&lt;br&gt;So this is not unique to Kaspa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important distinction you need to realise is that pruning old block data does NOT mean skipping consensus verification. Nodes still validate consensus, enforce rules and track UTXO state. They just don&amp;#x27;t keep every ancient block at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887902&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61887873&lt;br&gt;As we&amp;#x27;ve established, Mr Sompolinsky, it&amp;#x27;s not that the old blocks weren&amp;#x27;t kept; they were lost. And a great deal of work has been done to recover what has been lost, but not all of it has been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888092&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone of you are lurking, it’s quite clear /biz/ is JIDF headquarters. They think their jewish humor doesn’t glow. Death to Judaism and all of its followers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888189&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you guys think about Xelis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888282&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885700&lt;br&gt;7 and maybe 0 if she’s a squirter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888292&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885700&lt;br&gt;Rolan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61888770&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885700&lt;br&gt;9 is the only one I&amp;#x27;d have sex with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889128&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885700&lt;br&gt;7 and 9, that&amp;#x27;s it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>BTC dumping?

Enjoy holding your digital bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878193&lt;br&gt;Not exactly accurate there&amp;#x27;s a few beanie babies still fetching over a million right now anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878212&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877711&lt;br&gt;FUD only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878207&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;fetching&lt;br&gt;Why are they all the same price if they&amp;#x27;re an appreciating asset?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878248&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878207&lt;br&gt;Just because you ask for a price doesn&amp;#x27;t mean you&amp;#x27;ll get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877979&lt;br&gt;No. You never share private keys. BTC is locked in a Bitcoin script where spending still requires the staker’s signature. If the platform disappears like I said, the timelock path lets you withdraw using Bitcoin only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878321&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877722&lt;br&gt;sure anon. why? tech, users, or just hoping for a pump?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878324&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878207&lt;br&gt;Can we make money here? I&amp;#x27;m so tired of negative PNL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878330&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878248&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s losers trade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878331&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;I own a lil bit of btc and eth myself (3% of my entire portfolio) but I would unironically love to see the entire crypto market going to 0. You bitcoin maxi retards need to wake up. Your 5k stack of crypto wont magically 100x in the next 5-10 years and make you rich lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878347&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878072&lt;br&gt;Nah. I’ve already explained it a bunch. DYOR anon. Either let BTC sleep or look into native, self custody setups and pick what fits you kek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878349&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869514&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the elites&lt;br&gt;There are many kinds of elites that compete against each other. Many of them want strategic reserves of BTC to trade with. BTC will never die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878352&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878331&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#x27;s wrong with btc maxis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878368&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877734&lt;br&gt;Damn! Taxi drivers don’t call tops and bottoms, they just repeat headlines. Stick to your plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878078&lt;br&gt;Not my crowd. Stay poor, anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;ve tricked myself with a berg-word for any situation!&lt;br&gt;good for you anon? what do you want me to do with this information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878386&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869360&lt;br&gt;And yet comex+cme can evaporate 10 trillion in market cap in three days. Going to take one from the xrp schizos and say mcap doesn&amp;#x27;t mean anything. Still hold actual metals and not paper derivatives though...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879258&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878113&lt;br&gt;If crypto is dead, why is the onchain activity, stablecoins, and L2 growth still there? Price isn’t the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880618&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878349&lt;br&gt;Someone gets it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882946&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878376&lt;br&gt;It depends on you anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882959&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Polkadot decoupling from Bitcoin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883795&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877290&lt;br&gt;Based. We’ve all seen how “temporarily custodial” ends. NGMI if you outsource sovereignty and then act surprised when it rug-pulls itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883846&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878331&lt;br&gt;the problem with btc is it used to be the gambling outlet than we got kalshi, polymarket, all the sports gambling. no one cares about up down anymore, theres 100000 different things to gamble on. they&amp;#x27;re sucking up all the crypto money. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;god damn tho those 7.10 kalshi stock options. how about build something instead of try to piggy back someone else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883859&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;Who thinks ANY crypto is worth it....in 2026!?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not old stuff then, what NEW crypto will be 100 or 1000 times on Monday, faggots?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885711&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882959&lt;br&gt;it just hasn’t dumped yet. wait for BTC to sneeze and we’ll see how independent it really is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886601&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883795&lt;br&gt;Finally! Not your keys, not your coins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887813&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Short term volatility doesn’t change the plan.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Is a cope created by broke people. Bye, broke person. Enjoy the shift tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
