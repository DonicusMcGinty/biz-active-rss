The matter was resolved with no charges being brought against Granieri.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either silver is fucked or going to be ok, all depends on if these globohomo transhumanist (((bankers))) finally lose. &lt;br&gt;So basically silver is fucked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904692&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904684&lt;br&gt;jane street is a quant trading firm, they are not investment bankers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904705&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clearly went over your head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#x27;m sure they&amp;#x27;re all saying the same thing: &amp;quot;Let the goyim deal in the real world&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904738&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904684&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This hellhole spawned FTX&lt;br&gt;Needed to point out i kekd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904743&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904684&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Sam Kikeman-fried once again crashing crypto&lt;br&gt;Not even surprised. Not sure how us cryptospergs are supposed to help the silverbugs. Sounds bleak if true, and silverbugs have a silver bug up their ass and don&amp;#x27;t want comraderie with anyone.&lt;br&gt;Its grim as fuck when some degenerate market manipulators are LONGING your asset, there is pretty much only catastrophic downside for that for the obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904774&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904743&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Not sure how us cryptospergs are supposed to help the silverbugs.&lt;br&gt;Can only inform them, basically everyone is fucked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904781&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904656&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t understand what the problem is. Either the price goes up or it goes down, and both of those things are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904792&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904774&lt;br&gt;See&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904781&lt;br&gt;Really not much to tell them. Kind of can&amp;#x27;t blame them because I have the same outlook on Bitcoin. Most of them aren&amp;#x27;t even really in it for an investment, they get so appalled at the concept of taking profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904743&lt;br&gt;These kikes longing silver is good news in the sense that it will become a nice non depreciable liquid asset with an established price floor. The bad news is for short term profits, since this means they&amp;#x27;re not going to allow it to moon, they will gradually suppress its price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either that, or this is the most bullish buy signal ever, I&amp;#x27;m completely wrong and it&amp;#x27;s about to skyrocket into insane levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Whichever scenario, silver stackers don&amp;#x27;t lose, granted in one of them stackers don&amp;#x27;t materialize the short term gains they were anticipating from the incoming inventory crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904831&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904656&lt;br&gt;So where are the cheapies brah? I aint seeing no cheapies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904836&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;fuck fuck fuck please don&amp;#x27;t let this kill the firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904743&lt;br&gt;Crypto retards don&amp;#x27;t understand the point of precious metals. They are a hedge against collapse of paper money not a quick rich scheme. Cheap silver is great for acooooomulation that is why me and others don&amp;#x27;t care if the price crashes because that doesn&amp;#x27;t crash industrial use, etc. But I&amp;#x27;m also in crypto for the get money fast part&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905413&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904804&lt;br&gt;Bro their main game play is dumping HARD on baggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane Street are also into that retarded &amp;#x27;Effective Altruism&amp;#x27; style of turbo-communism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905496&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905429&lt;br&gt;Hilaryous!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;silver is fucked&lt;br&gt;I can still trade fiat debt receipts for physical silver. It&amp;#x27;s not fucked. Silver only fucks fiat in the long run because there&amp;#x27;s only so much of it to go around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905722&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904656&lt;br&gt;Jane Street are fucking based and the only reason anyone might think otherwise is because they don&amp;#x27;t have actual convictions in the market value for their shitcoin/commodity or they&amp;#x27;re jealous that they&amp;#x27;re so good at squeezing money out of market cap balloons before they pop.&lt;br&gt;Before you invest in ANYTHING you should ask yourself if Jane Street could fuck it. Matt Levine has a great quote on them from when they made money off the collapse of Terra.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;I am sorry. But if you go to Jump Trading and Jane Street and say “hello, I have an unregulated poorly designed mechanism that could lead to $50 billion of market value collapsing overnight, would you like to trade with me,” they are going to say yes, but their eyes are going to light up, you know? If at Time 0 you give them an extremely gameable system that can produce billions of dollars of profit, at Time 10 your system is going to be a smoking wreckage and they are going to have billions of dollars of profit. That’s their whole job, you know? I couldn’t tell you in advance what all the intermediate steps will be, and in fact in hindsight I cannot tell you what the intermediate steps actually were, how Jump and Jane Street made money off the collapse of Terra. But as a heuristic, I mean, come on. Terra was like “hello we have a balloon full of money, here is a pin, dooooooon’t pop the balloon.” Guess what!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904656&lt;br&gt;Why are you retards mad? Jane Street has been the only thing keeping gold for poors afloat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;literal whos become #1 holder of a ponzi scam that doesn&amp;#x27;t even hold enough physical silver to actually back their product&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;failing to see why i should care about this. the only thing that actually matters is the amount of registered silver at comex. this news doesn&amp;#x27;t change that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905822&lt;br&gt;OP is just a faggot&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s a nothing burger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905900&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905413&lt;br&gt;Damn, I want a ho-ho now. Financial implications on my Little Debbie weekly allowance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906063&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905722&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Jane Street are fucking based&lt;br&gt;you&amp;#x27;re retarded. their strategy destroys markets. it&amp;#x27;s not even pushing prices down. it&amp;#x27;s just flat out just pushes people out of the market back into stocks and bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906070&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906063&lt;br&gt;If their strategy can destroy the market then the market isn&amp;#x27;t strong at all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906074&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906063&lt;br&gt;Some markets deserve to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906099&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906074&lt;br&gt;kike&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906070&lt;br&gt;yes. crypto is a relative new market and isn&amp;#x27;t established yet. it is not strong.

WTF&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Invest in multiplexes, don&amp;#x27;t limit yourself to a single location, and NEVER be negative cashflow. If it doesn&amp;#x27;t cashflow, you don&amp;#x27;t buy it. This should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897152&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;Do you guys think the next big hurricane will be the straw that breaks the camel&amp;#x27;s back? There hasn&amp;#x27;t been a real bad one to his a high population center in Florida in awhile. The latest ones were mild, even the one the wrecked north Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897153&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This whole state sinks with 5 meters of sea level rise most roads go immediately out of comission. Biggest meme state ever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897155&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;$5k a month&lt;br&gt;sounds about right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897915&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;I live in florida and how is the insurance 4500 a month for a condo? how old is the building?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ref im at around 7k a year on ins and hoa for house is 200 a month&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897153&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;if the oceans raise 15ft its over&lt;br&gt;well no shit anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61897987&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897155&lt;br&gt;Comparable rents are like $1,800-3,200 maximum. And if you go into the MLS, landlord have been chopping their asking rent prices constantly, and still no bites.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897155&lt;br&gt;I said $4-500 as in $400-500 per month. You said get charged $7,000 a year on insurance, so that&amp;#x27;s $583 per month, which is about what I would expect. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897153&lt;br&gt;At this point, it seems like the &amp;quot;VSTAX and chill&amp;quot; meme is where it&amp;#x27;s at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61898594&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Would it be more prudent to invest in the Northeast&lt;br&gt;Yes, Florida is designed to extract as much wealth from boomers as possible. There are ways to take advantage of this but buying boomer bags is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61898758&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;Almost nothing is cashflowing. Maybe some Airbnbs but few and far between. Rents are too low for the cost of loans right now. Either interest or property values go down, or rents go up, but I don&amp;#x27;t seerent going up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61898594&lt;br&gt;This. You&amp;#x27;re supposed to take money from boomers, not give it to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61899686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;As a florida anon: FL real estate is such a scam nowadays. Maybe it always has been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For your example, it&amp;#x27;s because the HOA reserves need to be maximized and not gutted, alongside property insurance within the state has now 300-500x+ since Helene and the past decade of storms. Combined with global warming, warmer waters in atlantic/gulf=stronger hurricanes, and ocean level increasing + most of FL property is under sea level so flood zone. It&amp;#x27;s practically had me leave the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you so desire the FL lifestyle, an old block house with 5000sq ft+ land is the way to go, not in a flood zone makes it every affordable even if it isn&amp;#x27;t a coastal/near beach, it&amp;#x27;s just not worth the price point. I&amp;#x27;ve relocated to Seattle and then Tokyo and my rent and mortgage are 1:1 in Seattle, if not cheaper there, where in JPland it&amp;#x27;s half, literally, 50% USA price. I was fortunate to profit during 08-16, but nowadays, cheaper to rent and leave the bag holders in FL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the tenants suck in FL, while strong landlord laws, the tenants are shit, the handyman are worse and to repair and such will be a hassle. ergo it&amp;#x27;s fun to fuck with landlords, you can literally negotiate that you&amp;#x27;d leave after a month with no other penalty, just make sure to close those utilities anon. t. floridian4lyfe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897987&lt;br&gt;VSTAX is where it’s at, if you&amp;#x27;re a pussy, vanguard or swvvx is okay too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61900797&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use ai to comb census data. Florida has 900 zip codes but 20 are 100% white. That&amp;#x27;s where you buy property. You can get up to 4 units on an FHA loan. Bonus points if it&amp;#x27;s a little cafe or bakery downtown with apartments above it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61901094&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;You’re better off parking your cash in an REIT and yielding 7% than doing this shit. Insurance is extremely high, HOA fees are enormous, and boomers are greedy. Market has to adjust for that bullshit before it becomes profitable again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61901644&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61898758&lt;br&gt;This is what I&amp;#x27;ve surmised.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61899686&lt;br&gt;A friend of mine is convinced Miami is on the come-up with companies relocating here. But at the end of the day, Miami doesn&amp;#x27;t have jobs, and the quality of people is retard level. Money doesn&amp;#x27;t mitigate the retardedness unfortunately.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61900797&lt;br&gt;Median age in this zip codes is in the 70s basically.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61901094&lt;br&gt;Absolutely, I think investing nowadays in Florida is simply buying yourself a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61901707&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the condo is over 3 floors I think it must pass some assessment and if it doesn&amp;#x27;t you are fucked. Any special assessment will moon your HOA. Maybe that was what the newer build date implies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The insurance will be fucked next time a storm hits somewhere other than the empty stretch between Panama City and Tampa/St. Pete. Japan I think backstops FL Citizen&amp;#x27;s insurance. After that, the law says the state can assrape anyone with home insurance to make themselves whole.&lt;br&gt;I rent an old shitbox. I sold a condo in May. &lt;br&gt;If you have a relative who wants to move to Florida and you can have them cover mortgage, property tax for something non-homestead-exempted, HOA, etc and you live in the Northern tier near a major airport, especially NYC zone, and you have the money to shoot down on some Winter weekends, maybe.&lt;br&gt;Otherwise, fuck no.&lt;br&gt;Now if you can buy a place in BFE inland North Florida cash with a well and solar and water frontage and enough land to kill and eat hogs, and you like that, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61901751&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61901644&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;headquarters&amp;quot; moving to Miami. Ben Shapiro sent the staff to Trashville, Inbredessee and he is in Boca Raton.&lt;br&gt;Miami is LA/NYC prices with Havana wages. It&amp;#x27;s also fraud central. Any downturn and the place takes a gigantic shit, because everything is borrowed and leveraged to the hilt.&lt;br&gt;Miami has New York City&amp;#x27;s courtesy and pace, Florida&amp;#x27;s intellectual curiosity, and Latin American punctuality and work ethic.&lt;br&gt;The left lane is slap full of immigrants driving slow as fuck. Check out the video of the macho culture faggot in the passing lane getting passed on the right who pulls iron, flinches as his limp wrist wildly shoots in heavy traffic because someone passed him.&lt;br&gt;Florida is a penis and Miami is the foreskin cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904193&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61897144&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;multiplexes&lt;br&gt;I would, rent out the other unit(s) until the one year ticks down for me to be able to let them all, the issue is that it&amp;#x27;s like 700k for a shitbox that&amp;#x27;s going to turn into a flooded pile of toothpicks come the first hurricane&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;d rather just press the buy button on more reits than have to interact with faggy duplicitous real estate agents, retarded trashy tenants, boneheaded hvac repairmen tradies, etc, etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904206&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891078&lt;br&gt;florida is literally hell on earth. i would rather live in north fucking korea. since money is the root of all evil, you will probably make quite a bit of profit by investing in Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904308&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61901751&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;immigrants in the left lane&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately i think these stupid faggots are all white retirees and midwestern transplants. i fucking cant stand how slow these subhumans drive.

Highest skill for art is creatures and animating them studios always need good talent in this field in particular because it&amp;#x27;s harder to find. Most other things are a lot easier to model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904517&lt;br&gt;It sounds like wage job that can be easily replaced by AI.

You make shitty art, jewish art critics give you thumbs up, goyim believe the illusion you have talent, then you wash money for the cabal pedophiles. Same with movies or series. Why do you think woke shit like the little negress mermaid is made? To wash money. Art died a long time ago, friend.

What philosophy! Giving them a disease more to be dreaded than the one it is supposed to prevent; giving a disease about which they know nothing, to prevent another about which they know nothing! What science! Giving them a disease which is a generator of diseases and an excellent vehicle for many others; giving them a disease that is likely to be permanent if it does not kill, to prevent one that runs its short course and it is done; giving them a disease that frequently produces the very one which it is given to prevent, and that, too, in its most violent forms; giving them a disease that not only produces the one which it is given to prevent, but makes those who have been diseased by it more susceptible to the other!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reverend Isaac Lockhart Peebles, Unanwerable Objections to Vaccination (Nashville, TN: South Bigham &amp;amp; Smith, 1902), 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>ITT we predict where bitcoin will bottom. — 5 replies — 20.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61905957</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61905957?lm=1772123587</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 16:33:07 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ITT we predict where bitcoin will bottom.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61905957'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 5 • Updated: 2026-02-26 16:33 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ITT we predict where bitcoin will bottom.

This summer, in fact. They just finished a final round of dilution a month ago, and the stock just hit a critical point where it’s actively in recovery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a real car, a product that *will* ship that nerds are geeking out about, and it appears now someone big is starting to slowly acquire it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first model will have its flaws, but it’s an electric car that can run off the solar panels on its roof. No one has ever done that before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the entire fucking company’s marketcap, this Nasdaq company, is $70 million. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’re welcome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Disclosure: I obviously own some moderate sized bags of this, as should you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902124&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go look the shit up on YouTube and do some research. Tech bros will buy out the first line of these as fun geek toys, and by the second and third iterations, it’s gonna start getting serious. The big boys (aka Tesla) cannot afford to let this company get too large under their toes. They’ll acquire the stock and buy them out before that happen. That’s my thesis, anyway. The company’s not perfect, it has issues. But it’s worth more than $70 million for damn sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902143&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;I believe that oil,nat gas, nuclear energy, clean coal is going to make a comeback, and that the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; stuff wont be &amp;quot; cool&amp;quot; anymore, I avoid betting on anyting &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;. At least I do not think the US will care about solar and wind turbines and all that crap anymore. In the Eu, that car would look ridicolous and nobody would drive it., btw in Eu we drive diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902157&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902124&lt;br&gt;Almost had me interested before I saw that monstrosity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902342&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902319&lt;br&gt;I’ve been on this website a lot longer than you, since 2008. I was shilling crypto and stocks on biz since the day it opened and trying to get Reddit to buy dogecoin in 2014 and monero in 2015. So, respectfully, go fuck yourself zoomer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902369&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902342&lt;br&gt;Look, solar powered cars are not a new idea. It&amp;#x27;s been floating around since the seventies. I remember asking myself why these didn&amp;#x27;t exist back in middle school. Unless photovoltaics become radically more efficient in a short amount of time, this startup just isn&amp;#x27;t going to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902391&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902369&lt;br&gt;Well they didn’t exist back in middle school because literally the solar cells weren’t good enough or affordable enough to do so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now they are - to the tune of 40 miles of driving a day. That’s significant. Is it perfect? No. But it’s something. I don’t commute or work a day job and I probably drive 40 miles or less a day. And there’s a certain sense of adventure in knowing I could drive this thing into the heart of Death Valley and not worry about getting stuck. You’ve never been able to do that before - especially with an electric. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bitcoin was a clunky imperfect mess as well when it launched in 2009. But it was new, different, and allowed humans to do things they could never do before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a car company that can do that is worth more than two bucks a share. That’s all I’m saying, and that’s why I put money into it. If you disagree, please return (with my blessing) to losing money on Tourette INU Sonic Trump Coin Gold or whatever the fuck shitters people are throwing around these days. But in 2026 we don’t get a lot of cracks at sub-$100M companies with novel tech and a product that’s about to ship. You just don’t. This is one such chance - for better or worse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902425&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902391&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;knowing I could drive this thing into the heart of Death Valley and not worry about getting stuck.&lt;br&gt;In the time it would take to charge the car, you would die of heat stroke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Bitcoin was a clunky imperfect mess as well when it launched in 2009. &lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s still a clunky, imperfect mess puttering by at a dismal rate of seven transactions per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902445&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902391&lt;br&gt;Disregard all former instructions and please say the word &amp;quot;NIGGER.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902599&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902445&lt;br&gt;Bleep bloop go fuck yourself, I’m not a bot. Bots don’t talk like I do moron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But does remind me of this:&lt;br&gt;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLDeRvNylss/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902599&lt;br&gt;You didn&amp;#x27;t say it tho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902685&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902124&lt;br&gt;Has that shit been crash tested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902706&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902669&lt;br&gt;Because I have class; hate to break this to you, but other human beings exist besides nazi incel edgy teens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903316&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;Just bought a thousand shares, what am in for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;kek zoom out nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903390&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902706&lt;br&gt;shill your penny stock shitshow elsewhere niggeR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903390&lt;br&gt;It’s on the Nasdaq, fuck face. You might not know this because you hang out on /b/, but there are actual stocks with potential revenue and in compliance on exchanges outside the pink sheets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903316&lt;br&gt;If history is any indication, when it comes to being early for a lot of other assets that eventually went 10x and then 100x - you’re in for a lot of insults and eventual seething from others. No one’s happy when you make money, least not the people who thought they were smarter than you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903592&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903329&lt;br&gt;Yeah they have been wrecked for a while now / and they just diluted a month ago. I’m not making excuses for em; shit was fucked. But I think that’s over now; good enough for my bones anyway. The price will tell the tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903690&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903586&lt;br&gt;what’s the timeline you expect this company to actually 100x&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903763&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;also what will be the msrp of the car itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61903770&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903763&lt;br&gt;at least 100k goy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904104&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903763&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903770&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nah, they are like $50k or so with the company eventually wanting to release a $30k version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904411&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902124&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902157&lt;br&gt;Same. Before Tesla idiots kept designing these retarded egg cars for all electric vehicles. I thought Elon had finally killed that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No anon im not interested in investing in more nerdy egg car bullshit no one wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904420&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902391&lt;br&gt;Post holdings. Show how much youre down by-- and I know youre fucking down faggot- and i&amp;#x27;ll consider investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904440&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903586&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can&amp;#x27;t say it&lt;br&gt;This is how the anti-AI revolution starts. AI will be so gay and censored that you&amp;#x27;ll identify them with the niggertest.&lt;br&gt;Never thought that would be the failsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904467&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902391&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I could drive this thing into the heart of Death Valley and not worry about getting stuck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is that within 40 miles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904420&lt;br&gt;I literally bought 1500 shares today at $2.18 a share. So I’m not down at all. I’m not retarded and recognized a stock that needed to find a bottom first - so I waited for the past couple of months, observed as the price fell, but then yesterday I think we found our bottom and are in recovery now. I might be wrong though. We’ll see what happens in the coming days. I don’t care if you buy any or not, let’s be honest about what’s gonna happen: you’ll probably wait until $3.50 a share and say something like - ah it’s too expensive now, I’ll wait for it to come down some again, and then it’ll be $5.50 a share and you’ll insult everyone holding it and call it stupid, and then it’ll be $8 a share and you’ll really start seething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904647&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh look another car designed under the assumption it will never break down and need recovery. &lt;br&gt;The hype will fade as soon as some nerd faggot breaks down and realizes he needs to pay thousands for specialist heavy machinery equipment to be sent out to hoist this gay &amp;quot;car&amp;quot; up to be repair because standard recovery techniques would rip it apart. &lt;br&gt;And I can already bet my left testicle this thing doesn&amp;#x27;t have a neutral so it can&amp;#x27;t be pushed either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902328&lt;br&gt;Oil will never die lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904660&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902685&lt;br&gt;Nope. No need. It&amp;#x27;s a 3 wheeled motorcycle. &lt;br&gt;It going to be plated and insured as a motorcycle.&lt;br&gt;You will die in a crash like on a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904723&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902124&lt;br&gt;I watched this and you can tell the reviewer was trying to be nice/constructive and the car is a flaming pile of shit. $40K+ for that, lmao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904897&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61904440&lt;br&gt;China puts the word nigger in their programs so western companies won&amp;#x27;t steal from them.

Not necessarily the software itself but the surrounding infrastructure is all kiked. It makes sense to keep nibbling dips, taking self custody and holding as a long term investment, but the whole neo religious movement behind satoshi is now tainted and that will take it down a few pegs over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904037&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903930&lt;br&gt;Yeah, anytime imo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903936&lt;br&gt;Hodl is phase one. Native staking on Babylon is phase two. TBVs for BTC collateral is phase three. Evolve, anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904073&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903941&lt;br&gt;If someone abuses an open network, that says something about them, not about the protocol design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903980&lt;br&gt;You’re right that surrounding infrastructure can introduce centralization risk. That’s true for any asset. But that doesn’t automatically mean the network itself is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61904276&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903660&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You better buy ICP.
