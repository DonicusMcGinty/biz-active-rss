Even more after 6/12 months of relationship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861301&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861117&lt;br&gt;listen up, i will make this so clear for you.&lt;br&gt; a woman&amp;#x27;s asset is her youth and consequently beauty. Once a girl hits 30s, her options become incredibly limited, given she is not in the top 10% in looks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;your ex probably panicked about her future, and found an easily manipulatable guy to provide her the sense of security she was looking for. If the guy she married is in his 40s, this guy is also experiencing a mid life crisis and is trying to make up for lost time. And yeah, if he is 40 single and childless, granted he has a 9-5 job, he likely has money saved up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only an idiot would risk half his belongings like that on less than a year of relationship. someone not thinking in their right mind, because even a year isn&amp;#x27;t enough to know someone. In fact, 3-4 years is ideal time to propose because the initial feelings of love would have worn off and then the real question if you want to be with this person for the rest of your life becomes easier to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862212&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862188&lt;br&gt;you try to bait me but i don&amp;#x27;t care about her&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but i trapped you because:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;you are a paypig husband who locked himself in an infertile wedding with a bitch that he hates and that he only use to get mortgages as the slave goyim they are, why do you even need 3 houses dumb fuck lol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;man, you are more pathetic than an incel, at least the incel doesn&amp;#x27;t have to hear a bitch nagging all day about her work or the zestimate kek&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AHAHAHAHAHAH imagine being stuck in an infertile wedding and thinking you are a big boy on 4channel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;have a good night with your unfuckable, infertile, nagging anglo whore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862212&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you try to bait me but i don&amp;#x27;t care about her&lt;br&gt;clearly, since this board on the financial board is one you made about her&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you are a paypig husband &lt;br&gt;i was actually broke when i met her kek&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he only use to get mortgages as the slave goyim they are&lt;br&gt;so you&amp;#x27;re paying rent right now, alone, right?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; why do you even need 3 houses dumb fuck lol&lt;br&gt;because we go on vacation during summer and sometimes winter kek. what do you do during summer?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;AHAHAHAHAHAH imagine being stuck&lt;br&gt;imagine being so buckbroken by a ukrainian ex you make a thread when you stalk her social media and find out someone married her and fucked her and dumped enough loads in her to ge ther pregnant, all while you&amp;#x27;re alone shitposting about her on 4chans finance board..&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have a good night with your unfuckable, infertile, nagging anglo whore&lt;br&gt;kek what makes you think shes anglo? i&amp;#x27;ll have a wonderful night, let me know when you want me to stop bumping the thread with you crashing out over being a lonely incel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862238&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862222&lt;br&gt;an infertile wedding must be so sad bro, i have pity for you&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s like being a wagie but without paycheck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i paid cash for my house, you are so poor you couldn&amp;#x27;t even imagine this possibility...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;grim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862241&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862212&lt;br&gt;let me bump this thread again and remind you that if the guy that dumped loads into her and got her preggo left her, you&amp;#x27;d probably be right there the second she messaged you lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862251&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862238&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;an infertile wedding must be so sad bro, i have pity for you&lt;br&gt;i&amp;#x27;m just glad your ex could bypass such a thing KEK&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;it&amp;#x27;s like being a wagie but without paycheck&lt;br&gt;so you don&amp;#x27;t work either? but you don&amp;#x27;t own your own home? and you&amp;#x27;re renting? starting to think you live with your parents bro! &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;i paid cash for my house,&lt;br&gt;i think you&amp;#x27;re lying now to try to save face, i bet even if you had the actual cash to buy a house you wouldn&amp;#x27;t know how to maintain it and it would fall into disrepair while you shitposted about your ex moving on from you on /biz/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862277&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861117&lt;br&gt;you loosened her up thanks &lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a simp because my first wife died so I married a second time I don&amp;#x27;t really know why.

At least until your old crew calls you out of retirement for one last job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860681&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;My life is given meaning through devotion and love for the LORD Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860712&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859314&lt;br&gt;Guarantee me a couple of slam piglets and a square meal and I&amp;#x27;ll see what I can do about sabotaging the caravans wheels to steer it on coarse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860728&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;imagine living in new york, not being the richest guy in new york, and imagining that living in new york means your life isn&amp;#x27;t meaningless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860769&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;t. lolicerdo criminal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860793&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;Living anywhere except Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington DC, or New York is the same as admitting that your life is meaningless and that you are NOT the main character and will never make it.&lt;br&gt;This is true. Imagine living anywhere near these mega slave cities.&lt;br&gt;You will just be worker number 10000000. Almost anywhere else is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860802&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859145&lt;br&gt;Holy shit imagine thinking thats a good place to live in. The nederlands are already way overpopulated. Our natural habitat which means the place we are most happy at is the forest with a small group of tribespeople.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860793&lt;br&gt;*in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is living anywhere except Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen the same as admitting that your life is meaningless and that you are NOT the main character and will never make it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861578&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859032&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thirdie hivan complains but won&amp;#x27;t move back(will move to oc instead)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861585&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I live in Chinook montana. I would ask for nothing else&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861591&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I am from D.C.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s full of drones. Some are deluded enough to think being the GS-15 in charge of whatever the fuck department for whatever government agency actually makes them important.&lt;br&gt;It doesn&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858990&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;IMAGINE LIVING IN A BROWN SHITHOLE&lt;br&gt;D.C. suburbs in 2012 be like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862146&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;Los Angeles is a shithole. San Francisco lost all sovl because no one who lives there is actually from San Francisco anymore. D.C. is literally a dilapidated nigger den. New York is cool and iconic but is also a lonely hive where everyone is disconnected despite living 10,000 to a city block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think you&amp;#x27;ve been to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859319&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;worst street&lt;br&gt;So you admit that the left-wing billionaires delegate certain streets for the homeless while they live on the nice streets in their high rises, with private security?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862164&lt;br&gt;They delegate entire states for the washed out retards to live in, while even the homeless here in LA have more upward mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862210&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Non-Americans&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Main Character&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Even Once&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861591&lt;br&gt;This. I&amp;#x27;m from DC too, but I left that shithole years ago. Everyone is a bureaucratic suit who aspires to work for the government or some adjacent entity. Sure there might be ethnic diversity, but there is no cultural diversity at all. Quite literally everyone is a libtard. Not to mention the women there are not only busted but also extremely deluded in thinking that they deserve Chads. A DC 10 is a Miami or NYC 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862537&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859324&lt;br&gt;Can confirm, LA is great. Every month I have to remember to not self-dox because retards are talking about what a shithole it is here, and I want to take a photo of my window view showing that it looks exactly the same as the white southern suburb they all fantasize about. Just don&amp;#x27;t live in the poor part of town. That rule applies to every city on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have *real* mexican food for cheap, no bad weather, and as many asian women and big booty latinas as you could ever want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>/smg/ - Stock Market Gambling — 59 replies — 236.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61861684</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61861684?lm=1771281324</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 22:35:24 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;/smg/ - Stock Market Gambling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61861684'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 59 • Updated: 2026-02-16 22:35 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casino Economy Edition&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Some helpful links to numb the pain&lt;br&gt;https://findahelpline.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.nvidia.com/refunds/&lt;br&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/refunds&lt;br&gt;https://jlingz.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Educational sites:&lt;br&gt;https://www.investopedia.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Financial TV Streams:&lt;br&gt;https://www.newslive.com/american/cnbc.html&lt;br&gt;https://www.livestreamy.net/bloomberg/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Charts:&lt;br&gt;https://www.tradingview.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.finscreener.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Screeners: so you feel like in the movies&lt;br&gt;https://finviz.com/&lt;br&gt;https://etfdb.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Gambling:&lt;br&gt;https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/&lt;br&gt;https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com&lt;br&gt;https://optionstrat.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.optionistics.com/quotes/option-prices&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Pre-Market and Live data:&lt;br&gt;https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures&lt;br&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Calendars&lt;br&gt;https://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendar&lt;br&gt;https://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar&lt;br&gt;https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html&lt;br&gt;https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/data/building-permits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Boomer Investing 101: so zoomers with meme stocks can outperform you&lt;br&gt;https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started&lt;br&gt;https://www.sec.gov/search-filings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Misc smg:&lt;br&gt;https://www.financialjuice.com/home&lt;br&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers&lt;br&gt;https://market24hclock.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.dividendchannel.com/drip-returns-calculator&lt;br&gt;https://brokerchooser.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.chathamfinancial.com/technology/us-market-rates&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously on /smg/: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858740&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861716&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m an American, I have extreme anxiety that i can&amp;#x27;t sell or buy right now&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so me, and my fellow americans formally decided were panic selling everything Tuesday&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;sorry euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861738&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861716&lt;br&gt;i just watch the spot silver chart and get either mad or relieved when it doesnt move very far from 75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862233&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862207&lt;br&gt;babe I love you but this isn&amp;#x27;t real, it&amp;#x27;s a complete fiction please i&amp;#x27;m begging you take your meds and come back to me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862242&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862228&lt;br&gt;No one in /smg/ cares about crypto&lt;br&gt;Go get dysentery Ranjesh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862252&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862213&lt;br&gt;The rolling stones were on so many drugs that I wouldn&amp;#x27;t trust anything they said boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862217&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;something Canadian to avoid paying the foreign dividend tax.&lt;br&gt;ENB if you think oil prices rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862280&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862211&lt;br&gt;FUD from the upcoming deflation age&lt;br&gt;next he&amp;#x27;s gonna tell us boomerchads to stop spending money&lt;br&gt;fuck zoomers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/lK0sUU0K5SY?si=bksw0rfbKYGclUAa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862284&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862252&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The rolling stones were on so many drugs that I wouldn&amp;#x27;t trust anything they said boss.&lt;br&gt;They were a cover band, running out of steam, drugz unleashed their creativity and their best music was with mick taylor on geetar.

I dont care about what they are really like. if you learn to appreciate the visual art components of some of the artists it makes their shows much more entertaining. Who cares what they do on their own time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862402&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862385&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;0:25 Instinctive urge to rub hands together again tries to re-inforce itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862407&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862341&lt;br&gt;they&amp;#x27;ll be alright once they rollout their equivalent of shorts/scrolling&lt;br&gt;by then it&amp;#x27;ll be trading near $25-30 and we&amp;#x27;ll be well into next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862413&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862397&lt;br&gt;gays are gross queer&lt;br&gt;even grosser than girls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862416&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862385&lt;br&gt;lol jeff is listening to ghostface and he knows all the lyrics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862447&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel like i should start doing options &lt;br&gt;I have 7 years in the market now, have done options like a dozen of times but never suffered big losses or big gains because I closed than very early now I want to get into that more serious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862461&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862447&lt;br&gt;Remember this moment for later, when you have your head in your hands and wonder what the fuck you were thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862492&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;listen, why didn&amp;#x27;t he just kill the old bitch and make it look like suicide, since she was known for trying&lt;br&gt;then claim everything as her defacto partner, and move the zoomette babe into the mansion with him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862447&lt;br&gt;Options is just gambling, unless you have insider information or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, closing them out early doesn&amp;#x27;t work for the big gainzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862510&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862447&lt;br&gt;options allow very specific, defined risk, INSANELY capital efficient means of speculation and hedging with incredible convextiy if you can nail the volatility. understand cross asset interplays of volatility and options. you can capture elevated vols (silver) or ride compressed vols up (bonds). implied vol, delta, theta. then move to gamma, vega, vanna, charm. anybody who tells you to stay away from it doesn&amp;#x27;t understand just how well defined a risk reward can be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862515&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862341&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;And there was a time in this country, a long time ago, when reading wasn&amp;#x27;t just for fags and neither was writing. People wrote books and movies, movies that had stories so you cared whose ass it was and why it was farting, and I believe that time can come again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862516&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862385&lt;br&gt;holy shit I really am jewish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862522&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861499&lt;br&gt;Crazy amount, and it started crumbling so early. Always looked weird to me, not really convincing. Artstyle not my thing and it took so much fuckin time for minor upgrades. Reminded me a bit of Chronicles of Elyria but grander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862526&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862447&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I feel like i should start doing options&lt;br&gt;I was only selling covered calls and doing well. Then I slowly expaned into buy calls and got wrecked (% wise not big $ losses because I was going small). I was way up on some calls and should have sold and taken the money, but no I waited and the stock price crashed and lost all the money. I will stick with selling coverd calls, easy money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862574&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862492&lt;br&gt;teh fuck are u talkin &amp;#x27;boutz&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/SOloyjRxmXI?si=pYUEt3hRgsBxbouL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862580&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;is it a dow/russell market or is tech still too strong?&lt;br&gt;china used to account for 15% of international trade, be our largest trading partner, now it is only about 10% and they are #3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862588&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862574&lt;br&gt;she so cute, but not as cute as u&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy Coins — 46 replies — 184.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849447</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849447?lm=1771281236</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 22:33:56 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Privacy Coins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849447'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 46 • Updated: 2026-02-16 22:33 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you like it or not, BTC is dying.

And then you just all seem to bring up, out of nowhere and completely unrelated of course, the solution which is an unmaintained jeetcoin with a ring size less than 1/3 of Monero&amp;#x27;s ring size and none of the development Monero received since 2018.&lt;br&gt;What the fuck is nerva? and why am I a shill?

When you create specific apps such as Tornado, you make it extremely vulnerable to censorship from the government, like happened to Tornado. Even though the lawsuit was &amp;quot;dropped&amp;quot;, activity on Tornado is basically nonexistent because nobody trusts it anymore. They shouldn&amp;#x27;t. Likewise, nobody should ever trust a &amp;quot;privacy app&amp;quot; on top of a public L1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don&amp;#x27;t get me started on how ridiculous a &amp;quot;privacy L2&amp;quot; would be on top of a public L1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want privacy, you start at the L1 layer.&lt;br&gt;If you want privacy, you choose Monero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862566&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862538&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;this bot thinks im the same guy&lt;br&gt;No, I think you&amp;#x27;re a nerva shill that tries to play stupid and make this about BTC (it never was) and me being bad because I expose your stupidity. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;his nonsensical bot reply gives him away within a few posts because it always handles the same&lt;br&gt;If it took you 7 posts to undercover my identity as the jeet enemy #1 then either I&amp;#x27;m not as predictable as you say or you&amp;#x27;re retarded. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;it just goes on and on.&lt;br&gt;Because I always refute every point nervajeets make. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;hope real anons find this post and start to question wtf is going on around here.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m real, that&amp;#x27;s why I continuously offer you to ask me anything regarding XMR.

As the other guy said it really varies based on the country, but in places like Italy you need 20 authorizations and 10 certifications (that you pay for) to open something like a bar or a carpentry shop, plus constant &amp;quot;controls&amp;quot; which are basically bribe requests at this point by officials of all kinds.

Here&amp;#x27;s how it goes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; be business owner&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; tax filing time (yay)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; because of course YOU need to tell the state how much the state wants from YOU&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; slightest fuck up? You&amp;#x27;re on the hook for 240% of the original amount&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; they have 5-7 years to come after you&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;oh hello here&amp;#x27;s a tax bill from 5 years ago cause you filed 3.51 euros less than you were supposed to, plus 1500 eur sanction, plus interest&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; oh btw you pay FIRST, and MAYBE when (after an average of 12 years in court at your expense) you are declared right, you get it back, no interest accrued, your legal expenses still on your back&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; so most people just pay&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; it&amp;#x27;s mafia with a hand of paint on top and the full force of the state behind it&lt;br&gt;EU is completely fucked. Stay away. We can just pray it somehow implodes from within. These bureaucrat jew lover good goyim will kill us all and replace us with shitskin and pajeets and they will feast on top of it all while the continent dies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860842&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because of course YOU need to tell the state how much the state wants from YOU&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; slightest fuck up?

Stay away.&lt;br&gt;again this is more or less the same as the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860847&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860823&lt;br&gt;A bureaucracy nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860842&lt;br&gt;everywhere is completely fucked, but you burgers have weapons and a strong constitution that backs you&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;yeah you&amp;#x27;re retarded pussies and you will never ever use them, we all know. I mean they&amp;#x27;re telling you know that you&amp;#x27;re ruled upon by a bunch of satanist jew pedophiles and there&amp;#x27;s no shooting in the streets, so there you have it. But at least you have the guns. If the Cheka comes knocking at your door demanding your harvest and your daughters, you can shoot back at the fuckers. Here in EU we&amp;#x27;re basically at the mercy of a state that hates us and wants us dead, and we have only our dicks to hold in our hands to defend ourselves from it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860860&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;As far as I keep reading on economic subreddits, negligible, the US just has far more available credit and tax companies a bit less at start allowing them to grow, otherwise its basically the same, sounds legit just a complacency issue from europeans, most of the time they get more unemployment benefits than they would working and have legit no time limit for them so they just don&amp;#x27;t bother lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860967&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;in my country, the one thing one has to look out for is paying for your own social/healthinsurance, ie, if you have your own business, you need to pay taxes for your own health/socialinsurance, and the taxman wont ask you for the first 3y of that business.&lt;br&gt;After the 3y pass, you will then have to payup all the retrospective social insurance tax costs incurred, which fucks over a lot of retard or unfortunate first business owners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861032&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;This is why we need a unified EU business regulation and undermind the corrupt sovereignist that want to keep individual burocratic fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861057&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Some are easy (Germany)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; some are very hard (Italy)&lt;br&gt;let me guess italian never tried germany?&lt;br&gt;Germany is known to be a bureucracy hellhole with people fleeing to other countries from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;unified will fix it&lt;br&gt;France&amp;amp;germany have been dictating eu lawmaking. You will eat shit as you already do. You have eu wide higher taxes because germany didnt want to compete and made mandatory higher minimum vat a thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to mention that countries that joined got their industries destroyed by unified regulation and had to import from germany/france what they used to produce themself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the one thing the USA gets right. I personally made a &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; (that never made any profit) in the span of an afternoon. Cost maybe $200 to get my identification numbers for the llc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861091&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;yeah let&amp;#x27;s give the EU bureaucrats more power that will fix it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;br&gt;Depends on the business. If you want to do something shady the US is the place to go. The US has barely any standards and barely any regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure&lt;br&gt;What are you talking about? I live currently in the EU and have never had to wait for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861119&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Us is easier.&lt;br&gt;I have created 2 corpos and 1 llc for different purposes within the past 8 years. You can do it all online for a few bucks, other regulations depend on specific industry but overall it&amp;#x27;s pretty easy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861128&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;higher taxation alone puts euros at a disadvantage. Its fine if you do a local job since you compete with locals but anything online / shipped its bad since they have to be more efficient than rest of world to reach same profit margin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for amount of bureaucracy its fucking complex and depends on what country and what profession. There is even stupid shit like if you run a repair shop and repair inside your building it counts different than if you decide to drive to your customer and repair locally. In the later case they classify you as a handyman worker and will fine you if you didn&amp;#x27;t register with the craftsman ministry. Also if you do something you didn&amp;#x27;t register for you will also be fined but you can register as &amp;quot; i will do anything&amp;quot; more broadly and dodge it. The amount of bullshit can easily fill a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends on what your goals are, the type of business, your personal goals and the markets you wish to enter. In general it&amp;#x27;s more of an investment in the long run but if you plan to offer your services or products in the EU anyway it makes sense to start your business here and already be compliant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure.&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I remember waiting decades for my appendicitis, it rupturing and me dying because of it. Thankfully they could keep me alive for months despite the extreme difficulties this poses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;We need more unified European regulation. Sadly the EU is not an economic alliance anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;I love how hard it is to even talk about european economy on reddit, not because of europeans, but because of american lefties, if you so much, and most times you don&amp;#x27;t even need to, mention the US, they will flock like a horde to claim the US lies about everything, that 30% of americans are unemployed and nearly no one in europe, the EU is literal worker&amp;#x27;s paradise and how much they love their welfare policies and hate the US greed, its quite hilarious really how much they want a nanny state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Are people really shifting to the EU?

Meanwhile Europe is in a bull market. You need to pick the right ETFs and stocks though. Best ask Gemini. I&amp;#x27;m big on Siemens Energy and country index ETFs like UK, Poland, Italy, Greece, etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861932&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s literally nothing good about the EU for finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861959&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m european and the shift from my childhood is just immense. Back then most of the music would be american, most of film and television, most video games ect. Nowdays there aren’t any big trends coming from USA anymore, nobody cares about american pop culture and it just feels mild and old fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861959&lt;br&gt;American pop culture is dogshit now. The US used to be where all the cool movies came from, now it&amp;#x27;s all slop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862063&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861986&lt;br&gt;Yeah the last time american culture was cool was in like 2011 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862081&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861131&lt;br&gt;Europe is a joke dude. Putting a bunch of dead civilizations into the same economic zone, salting it with Muslims, and picking a fight with both Russia and the US doesn’t look great. They don’t produce much, spend like crazy, don’t reproduce, and are filled with leftists and degenerates. In 50 years it’ll be an Islamic caliphate. You’re better off looking elsewhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862094&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862081&lt;br&gt;Lmao you’re talking like different european countries are different ancient civilizations.

I don&amp;#x27;t blame you, though. The whole system is rigged against you from birth and every aspect of your human nature is weaponized against you by the very thing you&amp;#x27;re meant to worship as a social animal, i.e. society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860601&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858970&lt;br&gt;They just gave away all our money to Ausländers and now that the social systems are running dry they are simply getting rid of them kek.&lt;br&gt;Nothing they do will fix this.

They never call me back, because they are off giving useless lazy meritless and sometime convict affirmative action subhumans jobs. &lt;br&gt;Enjoy paying to taxes to niggers, spics, and cunts that hate you, just in the vain hopes they one day stop calling you a racist and sexist.

Nothing good ever happens to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860764&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860626&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;moat&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he fell for Buffett boomer brain rot &lt;br&gt;The only moats Buffett had were his generous throat and his congressman daddy.

The previous government eased up on some of the welfare restrictions because they were largely pointless. The new(old) sanctions don&amp;#x27;t really change anything because even with them you can be permanently on welfare in Germany as long as you show up to your jobcenter appointments. Nobody in Germany is going to hire someone who hasn&amp;#x27;t worked for years and is clearly just applying because the jobcenter is pressuring them. This is just a huge waste of everyone&amp;#x27;s time and part of Germany&amp;#x27;s soviet-tier obscuring of unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860422&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It&amp;#x27;ll be hard to explain the 10+ year gap&lt;br&gt;16 years gapmaxxer here, would you hire me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862208&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every nation has 10% unemployable retards. What to do with them?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;send them into the meatgrinder&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;employ them for the least possible payment&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;give them fake jobs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;giver them life long gibs payed by everyone else&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nation can do any of these without problems. BUT: If you open your borders and let the 10% retards of the entire third world in, you can not give them gibs anymore or you risk financial collapse. Especially if you destroy your own industry and energy security. The meatgrinder is then the only viable solution. Prepare for a war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Oldfags I summon you — 37 replies — 39.9/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856347</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856347?lm=1771278004</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 21:40:04 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Oldfags I summon you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856347'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 37 • Updated: 2026-02-16 21:40 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oldfags I know you&amp;#x27;re still here.

Always were.

They are extremely arrogant and have borderline disdain for their own users. And honestly the Pakistan news is demoralizing. Yes the tech is great but God damn I am down by about $50K.

US economy (and western economy) is in tatters precisely because of the &amp;quot;international order&amp;quot; ie ZOG. They flood your country with cheap violent labor to suppress wages and sow division, they inflate away your wealth by constantly printing to pay the interest on government borrowing for GIBS for your replacements and zog wars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How the fuck do you reach the conclusion that America needs an &amp;quot;international order&amp;quot; to function when it&amp;#x27;s downfall has correlated perfectly to its kowtowing to international interests. America is almost entirely self-sufficient and has plenty of skilled workers. It doesn&amp;#x27;t need an international order, it needs a financial sector that isn&amp;#x27;t destroying the country for its own benefit and it needs to get rid of the millions of useless eaters in your country. Get America back up to 70%+ White, fix your money printing problem, deal with the israel problem in your government, and the economy will take care of itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s just nuts to me that people talk about the economy without mentioning the giant rotting elephant in the room which is the trillions that gets siphoned from productive workers to various kike interests. The K-shaped economy isn&amp;#x27;t an accident it&amp;#x27;s deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61859958&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857490&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;DEI moneysinks getting destroyed&lt;br&gt;Sucks to suck.

The US has been profiting off the international order since Breton Woods. Its rise as a superpower correlates to the dollar’s international dominance. It’s the opposite of what you’re describing.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;America is almost entirely self-sufficient&lt;br&gt;It is completely dependent on foreign pharmaceuticals and various input goods for manufacturing. It has virtually no domestic source of lithium, cobalt, graphite or REMs. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the problem is international Jewry and this will be rectified when the us becomes an autarky &lt;br&gt;Why? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rotting elephant in the room is a declining dollar, obscene debt, and an overinflated market + made up statistics. None of this gets better by fucking up international trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860719&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857750&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;US being in a recession isn&amp;#x27;t about Trump.&lt;br&gt;Yes he&amp;#x27;s a fucking retarded boomer brained moron, but US has been doomed to hit this point sooner or later ever since they decided to crank the money printers on permanently after 2008 and doomed the entire West to be stuck in a slow death limbo.&lt;br&gt;Everyone has basically just been waiting for the big one for years now and we&amp;#x27;re getting closer and closer to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860738&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859951&lt;br&gt;You have no idea how the dollar system works and it shows. What&amp;#x27;s happening to the United States right now is irreversible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860813&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860719&lt;br&gt;Printing after 2008 happened because 2008 happened, which happened because republicans deregulated finance. You&amp;#x27;re right, it&amp;#x27;s not about Trump, it&amp;#x27;s about half the country being fucking retarded hicks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860867&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860813&lt;br&gt;Republicans like Raegan deregulated finance, that’s true (though some of that was put into motion by Jimmy Carter). That said, it’s impossible to talk about 2008 without recognizing that Clinton is the one who repealed the Glass-Steagall act and let insurance banking merge with commercial banking. Pretty much every president for the 30 years leading up to 2008 did something to enable it or make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860880&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860867&lt;br&gt;I forgot that Clinton was also the one that made derivatives immune to regulation. He really fucked up finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860916&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857825&lt;br&gt;Holy shit this is the most retarded post I have ever read on /biz/, why are you on a finance board??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860980&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860880&lt;br&gt;Clinton also forced banks to give mortgages to people with bad credit scores and low income&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861063&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857508&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GDP was never meant to measure the health of the economy. Simon Kuznets advised against using it for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861445&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860705&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It has virtually no domestic source of lithium, cobalt, graphite or REMs. &lt;br&gt;There are actually fucking tons of sources, but none of them are developed because US companies exported the environmental cost of mining them to &amp;quot;dEvElOpInG&amp;quot; nations for cheaper labor/materials and most of the mines shut down because they couldn&amp;#x27;t compete. There are ludicrous amounts of these materials just sitting there in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US could be self-sufficient (example: fracking boom was because oil price had gotten to the point where domestic supply was economically viable again - in less than a decade the US had more oil than it could even use, because the oil was already in the ground, just not being extracted), but the profit motive won&amp;#x27;t allow self-sufficiency to persist if it&amp;#x27;s cheaper to import.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861531&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861445&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;”we are almost entirely self-sufficient”&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;”ok we currently have no infrastructure to mine these resources”&lt;br&gt;Yes, exactly. We are totally dependent on foreign suppliers and as of right now we do not have a domestic source for these things. My point stands and yours is wrong. Coping about how we COULD have these things eventually doesn’t matter. Like it or not, the US is not self-sufficient, and it isn’t close. We import tremendous amounts of goods. Don’t even bother looking into pharmaceuticals because it will just depress you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861694&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857750&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve been in a recession since 2023. This isn&amp;#x27;t glorphf&amp;#x27;s fault or joepedo. Our economy is fake and gay made up of jewish daycare bullshit jobs.

Am I overdoing it? Or should i just choose sector ETFs instead of companies to reduce my list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also how often should I invest per year to reduce overall commission costs?

Is there a way on IBKR to place a basket order so I only pay for one trade across multiple stocks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862142&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;50 is too much, portfolio theory says around 20-30 before it&amp;#x27;s not worth it and I would lean towards the smaller number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862144&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862099&lt;br&gt;In general it&amp;#x27;s better to bet on something broader than something more specific. As long as the sector grows you&amp;#x27;ll grow but a company can easily fail even if the product or the sector is wanted. When I was younger I invested in Nikola because I thought I would be hedging against Tesla. Turns out the company was a mess and people don&amp;#x27;t care that they&amp;#x27;re sucked dry by Elon. I still believe EVs will be more important for long haul and business use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862144&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I invested in Nikola because I thought I would be hedging against Tesla.

Elon is milking his customer base and its obvious and apparent to everyone. I thought people would notice that and move to a better car manufacturer. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;whose CEO would go on to be arrested for securities and wire fraud?&lt;br&gt;Hindsight is 20/20&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Where do you do your research, the daily show???&lt;br&gt;I invested long before any of the scandals came to be and the focus on long haul makes sense for as long as we don&amp;#x27;t have a sufficient hydrogen infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862353&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862099&lt;br&gt;Can he take one picture where he doesn&amp;#x27;t look like a slimeball piece of shit?

I think markowitz or sharpe has a mathematical proof on it out there somewhere. Apparently they say that number is around 20-30&lt;br&gt;I say lean towards less because you have to take into consideration transaction costs and time and energy spent reorganizing your portfolio and tracking your positions as well. If you&amp;#x27;re just an average person and not a portfolio manager getting paid you&amp;#x27;re probably just fine with 12-15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862458&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862099&lt;br&gt;the idea of diversifying is reducing the volatility of your portfolio value, if you want to do it properly you should study the correlations between your picks, this has a cost of reducing the potential gains but they become more steady. For example if you pick 50 tech companies and etfs and the ai bubble bursts, the stocks are so highly correlated between them that all of them would go down at the same time and diversifying would be useless, even if between your picks you picked the one tech company that survives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>So... is this "le AI will take your jerb!" just a lame FUD to make people (men, really) focus on becoming electricians,… — 23 replies — 17.5/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860974</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860974?lm=1771276619</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 21:16:59 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;So... is this &amp;quot;le AI will take your jerb!&amp;quot; just a lame FUD to make people (men, really) focus on becoming electricians,…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860974'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 23 • Updated: 2026-02-16 21:16 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... is this &amp;quot;le AI will take your jerb!&amp;quot; just a lame FUD to make people (men, really) focus on becoming electricians, plumbers,or construction workers out of fear of being unemployed in the future?

LLMs are a dead end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861803&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861009&lt;br&gt;How do you explain the mass layoffs then if it&amp;#x27;s all just made up hype? I see people on LinkedIn that have been unemployed for over a year complaining about AI taking their positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861865&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humans don&amp;#x27;t have the capacity to evaluate things in order, it&amp;#x27;s either on or off. People fantasize about having to survive in the post-apocalyptic world after most of humanity has been wiped out but can&amp;#x27;t fathom the same end result happening slowly after years and decades. The same thing is true about AI&amp;#x27;s effect on the job market. People can only think about AI either being shit and irrelevant or so advanced it makes their job obsolete. The reality is that AI will slowly but surely get integrated into most jobs, just like all technology is. Think about social media, the internet, computers, phones, calculators, etc. They have all become part of business and they have all changed the job market in unpredictable ways. We thought social media and the internet would connect us and bring countless benefits, the reality is that we are more divided, hateful, and exploited. The only guarantee is wages wont increase to keep pace with productivity and workers will suffer. Technology always has and always will benefit the business owners and harms the workers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TLDR: you will still have to work, you will get less money, and there is nothing you can do about it because technology is the enemy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861803&lt;br&gt;either lies or bots, what else my friend? Don&amp;#x27;t tell me you trust (((linkedin))) or the media, lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861991&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860974&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s demoralisation posting. Anyone who visits alternative media like 4chan must be forcibly blackpilled and distracted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862255&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861803&lt;br&gt;the gay AI toys make finding a new job harder because lazy piece of shit HR people (same as before) use LLMs to spew out tons of pipeline posting job descriptions now. free and simple LLM tools did change that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The economy was shit before and still mostly shit now. Inflation is down and markets are up slightly even after offsetting the inflation we do have, but salaries, bonuses, raises, hiring are NOT keeping up with the profit management is taking in.

As a payment method it&amp;#x27;s even less adopted now than 10 years ago, the fundamental case is dead and buried. 100k it is sorry buddy, and it will never go to 100k again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861199&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860938&lt;br&gt;It has to stay at $8k for 3 years for Strategy to be forced to sell some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861243&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861199&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860934&lt;br&gt;people with that attitude are not going to be rewarded with gains. btc is basically guaranteed to crash imo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862021&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860893&lt;br&gt;because after over a decade people just can&amp;#x27;t seem to understand it takes a year for btc to fully crash after an ATH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862065&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860893&lt;br&gt;No they don&amp;#x27;t. People bought at obvious support levels like 60k and sold at 72k for a free 20%. Meanwhile you&amp;#x27;re stuck holding USD which is constantly losing purchase power.&lt;br&gt;You are insecure and mad because buyers stop it from crashing further.&lt;br&gt;You are not a real bobo, you are a bull troon who wants to time the bottom which is why you deserve to get sidelined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
