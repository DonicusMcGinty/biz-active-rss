I am trying to explain how these conditions happened. While there are tons of reasons that Chinese manufacturing rose to prominence—huge cheap labor force that was previously kept away from foreign investment, America putting China on the MFN list—a consistently cheap currency is one of them, hence why they have been accused of currency manipulation for literal decades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Currency can ligma balls or be infinitely expensive compared to other currencies, it does not matter. It may seem that it does, but it does not.&lt;br&gt;This is just patently untrue. Obviously, if China’s currency were infinitely expensive, which would be the equivalent to having a self-imposed trade embargo, nobody would buy their products. What you would see is the rapid expansion of the industries that China has a monopoly on; a part of the reason that these industries do not pop up elsewhere is that potential manufacturers know that it’s difficult to compete with how cheap Chinese goods are, so why bother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You seem to genuinely believe that exchange rates do not ultimately matter in trade, which simply ignores how international trade functions. I’ll give you another example. After WWII, the US set Japan’s exchange rate intentionally low as a part of the Dodge Plan because they wanted a democratic stronghold in Asia, and they knew giving them a cheaper currency would help their export market. This worked TOO WELL. Over the course of the next forty years, Japan became so dominant in the export market that other countries began to panic and they “renegotiated” the exchange rate again at the plaza accords (this would have disastrous effects). If we were in the 80’s, you would point to Japan and say that “look at all the great products they make. It doesn’t matter what their exchange rate is,” and that would ignore the conditions that gave rise to their export dominance in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878109&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872971&lt;br&gt;Doesn&amp;#x27;t help them a bit. The chink economy is still in a deflationary death spiral and there is no way in hell its ever going to get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878121&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876956&lt;br&gt;Lmfao. You can produce whatever you want, when demand dies as it has for the last 6 years you are going to sit on overproduction. Add a corrupt communist bureaucratic political party tyranny that plays same asset re-leveraged ponzi to increase its monetary base you get economic deflation and monetary hyperinflation - that&amp;#x27;s the perfect breeding ground for insurgency &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ccp and Chinese bureaucrats and polity is going to be slaughtered in the streets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878126&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878121&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;/pol/tard word salad gibberish complete with the &amp;quot;hyperinflation&amp;quot; meme word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878133&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878126&lt;br&gt;Wumao&lt;br&gt;China is dead and has been for the better part of 13 years. All the corruption and attempts to paint over the political and economic failures are now coming home all at the same time. There won&amp;#x27;t be a &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; &amp;#x27;republic&amp;#x27; of China by 2030&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878137&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878133&lt;br&gt;I think you&amp;#x27;re Indian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878138&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878133&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;more /pol/tard word salad gibberish complete with foreign language pejorative meme word&lt;br&gt;if i had to guess: IQ ~80, GED or &amp;#x27;cyber high school&amp;#x27;, has never read a book in his life, career in manual labor for a wage between $18/hour and $22/hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878137&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878138&lt;br&gt;Wumaos &lt;br&gt;When the checks stop coming you gone. The rest of the country is going to slaughter you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878155&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878148&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When the checks stop coming you gone&lt;br&gt;Confirmed Indian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878160&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878155&lt;br&gt;Wumao, who do you think is first going to be rationalized away? You or chair man chang? You gonna die chink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878162&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878109&lt;br&gt;They made a bet that reaching out infrastructure to the hundreds of millions of people of low-productivity regions could improve domestic demand to the extent that their subsidies start to be consumed internally. The problem is that the low-productivity areas are, of course, low income and the only two options which exist to them are:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Direct UBI for low-income areas&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Creating even more highly subsidized factories to employ low-income people and give them a better wage&lt;br&gt;Honestly for them the UBI route is likely more cost-effective, to avoid further deflating the value of the plants they already have. The 3rd (much) more challenging and expensive option would be to migrate the sweat-shops and low-skill factories out to the countryside from bigger city centers and reassign the existing factories to high-tech, high-skill plants such as chip foundries and advanced component manufacturing. To a certain extent they&amp;#x27;re being forced into this already due to sanctions etc on high-end chips, but if it&amp;#x27;s their primary gameplan then it&amp;#x27;s progressing way too slowly. Modernizing a billion people (bugs) is a hell of a project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878168&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878160&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re stinking up the thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878171&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878162&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;UBI&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s the funny part, the polity as the bureaucracy as the socialist &amp;quot;billionaire&amp;quot; bastards that rely on the continuation of the sovereign bond ponzis are going to hang on the same gallows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878316&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878171&lt;br&gt;Are you ESL? I feel like I got schizophrenia just from reading your post&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880069&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874731&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;17% of the US population who are hooked on SSRIs get their supplies cut off, along with the active ingredients we buy from them for everything else. We lost the bio-warfare game before it even began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880124&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875629&lt;br&gt;Everything done by a government can be construed as being a subsidy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good infrastructure is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Skilled workforce is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Low crime rate is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Friendly regulatory environment is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Low cost of living for employees is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Ease of worker relocation and efficient job matching is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Low taxes due to government thrift is a subsidy&lt;br&gt;Etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880265&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873120&lt;br&gt;On the world though? Also where would China be without Amazon and Walmart like worse than Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880291&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875302&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;If a basket of various goods in the US goes for 100 dollars and that same basket of goods in Vietnam goes for 10 dollars (ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL), then a fair exchange rate would be 10 dong for one dollar&lt;br&gt;That is a made up rule. There is no fundamental reason for why 1 dong should have the same purchasing power as 1 dollar. Currency units are just made up. Vietnam could introduce a new currency superunit called the bong, say 1 bong is equal to 25,970 dong and also that 1 bong is equal to 1 dollar. That would satisfy your rule while also de facto maintaining the current exchange rate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a natural reason for why the basket is cheaper in dollar terms in Vietnam, which is the Balassa-Samuelson effect&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;There’s a reason why economists or even someone casually interested in the economy and trade policy use these terms.&lt;br&gt;Yes, because they are shills trying to find arguments for why China should make Chinese companies less competitive and/or arguments for why tariffs should be imposed against China. It&amp;#x27;s really all just to protect the profits of domestic companies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880291&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;say 1 bong is equal to 25,970 dong and also that 1 bong is equal to 1 dollar.&lt;br&gt;*say 1 bong is equal to 2,597 dong and also that 10 bong are equal to 1 dollar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880291&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;my rule &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;it’s literally just the most basic economics&lt;br&gt;Listen, I can’t explain exchange rates to you any more than I already have. Believe whatever you want. If you want to believe that exchange rates do not affect exporters or importers, go for it. It’s of no consequence to me if you sound retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880069&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;leftists kill themselves en masse after their meds run out leading to a 100 year Republican dynasty&lt;br&gt;Still not seeing the downside&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880558&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880545&lt;br&gt;The downside is that the mentally sound people are not going to just off themselves. They are going to take it out on everyone around them like they normally do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880558&lt;br&gt;mentally ill*&lt;br&gt;Ultimately its going to be an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880603&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880533&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not &amp;quot;basic economics&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiat currency units are arbitrary. Fiat currencies have no inherent or fair value because they aren&amp;#x27;t tied to anything real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;If you want to believe that exchange rates do not affect exporters or importers&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s not what I was saying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880653&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880603&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875302&lt;br&gt;Again, a currency does not have to have an underlying physical asset in order to have value in relation to something else. I’m not sure why you think it does. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not my pet theory. It’s just basic economics. Just look into Purchasing Power Parity, and if you don’t get it, that’s fine. Again, you can believe whatever you want. I’ve done my due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880707&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give it to me straight: Has China already won? It seems to be doing better than the west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880739&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880653&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not saying a fiat currency can&amp;#x27;t have value relative to something else. I&amp;#x27;m saying it does not have an inherent or fair value, and therefore it cannot be undervalued or overvalued. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I said a fiat currency is not tied to anything real, I meant that it&amp;#x27;s not backed by anything real fixed at any specific predetermined ratio. I did not mean that it cannot be exchanged for anything real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m familiar with PPP, and there is no reason why it should be the exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880750&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873505&lt;br&gt;currency you nigger, currency, not money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880812&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880739&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;#x27;m saying it does not have an inherent or fair value, and therefore it cannot be undervalued or overvalued.&lt;br&gt;It can be in relation to something else. &lt;br&gt;If one dong can buy a bicycle in Vietnam, and a dollar can buy a bicycle in the US, and this 1:1 ratio roughly carries across a multitude of good, and Vietnam’s nominal exchange rate for USD is 100:1, the currency is undervalued. It is worth much more than the nominal exchange rate suggests. Its real value *in relation to the US dollar* is higher than its nominal value. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; there is no reason why it should be the exchange rate.&lt;br&gt;It is not the exchange rate. It is a factor in the exchange rate. The reason makes sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is important to understand that we are talking about managed exchange rates here, and it’s much more obvious in these examples. Many economists also think that currencies can be undervalued/overvalued even if both currencies float freely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;As if China will give a shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>CRYPTO IS DEAD — 2 replies — 8.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61880718</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61880718?lm=1771621173</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 20:59:33 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;CRYPTO IS DEAD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61880718'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 2 • Updated: 2026-02-20 20:59 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crypto is dead.

I’ve been contacted by a couple of friends who never talk about crypto to tell me that it’s over and I was just in a taxi when the driver told me it’s finished. I’m scared to go and get my hair cut because I just don’t want to hear it from my stylist, then I’ll really know it’s over&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877954&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877158&lt;br&gt;Nope. If the platform disappears, your BTC doesn’t vanish. It’s still on Bitcoin under the lock you set, and you can withdraw when the unlock conditions are met. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877961&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877152&lt;br&gt;it nukes and pumps like everything else anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877965&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877155&lt;br&gt;You can hold both. It doesn’t have to be one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877979&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877954&lt;br&gt;You are sharing your keys with another entity. You are retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878072&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877979&lt;br&gt;Is it another centralized shit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878078&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;Welcum bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872347&lt;br&gt;It’s got maybe one more bull run left in it, but $150K is never happening. Ethereum is already at the &amp;quot;no new ATHs ever again&amp;quot; stage. Crypto is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878176&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869234&lt;br&gt;newfag alert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873082&lt;br&gt;you are genuinely retarded, keep making them stronger with your rocks but in the end it won&amp;#x27;t matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878193&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878176&lt;br&gt;Yeah and beanie babies as an asset class will come roaring back any day now. Enjoy holding your digital bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878193&lt;br&gt;Not exactly accurate there&amp;#x27;s a few beanie babies still fetching over a million right now anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878212&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877711&lt;br&gt;FUD only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878207&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;fetching&lt;br&gt;Why are they all the same price if they&amp;#x27;re an appreciating asset?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878248&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878207&lt;br&gt;Just because you ask for a price doesn&amp;#x27;t mean you&amp;#x27;ll get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877979&lt;br&gt;No. You never share private keys. BTC is locked in a Bitcoin script where spending still requires the staker’s signature. If the platform disappears like I said, the timelock path lets you withdraw using Bitcoin only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878321&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877722&lt;br&gt;sure anon. why? tech, users, or just hoping for a pump?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878324&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878207&lt;br&gt;Can we make money here?

You bitcoin maxi retards need to wake up. Your 5k stack of crypto wont magically 100x in the next 5-10 years and make you rich lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878347&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878072&lt;br&gt;Nah. I’ve already explained it a bunch. DYOR anon. Either let BTC sleep or look into native, self custody setups and pick what fits you kek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878349&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869514&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the elites&lt;br&gt;There are many kinds of elites that compete against each other. Many of them want strategic reserves of BTC to trade with. BTC will never die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878352&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878331&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#x27;s wrong with btc maxis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878368&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877734&lt;br&gt;Damn! Taxi drivers don’t call tops and bottoms, they just repeat headlines. Stick to your plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878078&lt;br&gt;Not my crowd. Stay poor, anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869212&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;ve tricked myself with a berg-word for any situation!&lt;br&gt;good for you anon? what do you want me to do with this information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878386&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869360&lt;br&gt;And yet comex+cme can evaporate 10 trillion in market cap in three days. Going to take one from the xrp schizos and say mcap doesn&amp;#x27;t mean anything. Still hold actual metals and not paper derivatives though...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879258&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878113&lt;br&gt;If crypto is dead, why is the onchain activity, stablecoins, and L2 growth still there? Price isn’t the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880618&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878349&lt;br&gt;Someone gets it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>ummm this is huge for chainlink??? — 29 replies — 62.9/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871679</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871679?lm=1771620199</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 20:43:19 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ummm this is huge for chainlink???&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871679'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 29 • Updated: 2026-02-20 20:43 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT.

I made a small fortune in the past 5 years doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876386&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;this is insane&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;less than 1% of the population is working more than one full-time position&lt;br&gt;Okay. Personally I&amp;#x27;m interviewing for a second job just because I want more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876391&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870855&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870872&lt;br&gt;Yeah we should be like Obama and just accept that jobs will never return.

Seriously you can&amp;#x27;t ask for a raise and give me one of your jobs? Then you mock me for failing to get a job? You are hogging 2 jobs. If you didn&amp;#x27;t work 2 jobs there would be room for unemployed people to have jobs too. Boomer X fuckers still don&amp;#x27;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;I hope you’re trolling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877277&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869343&lt;br&gt;as long as wagies keep waging, it aint doomed nigga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;People are working two or more jobs and you call this recession? Fucking hilarious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877311&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876310&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876213&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;SING UP FOR&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;like places are just a great volunteer association and not a rigorous shittest from hr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877894&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869507&lt;br&gt;There are 7 days a week anon. If you consider a 40 hour week a full time job, then an 80 hour week is two full time jobs. That&amp;#x27;s under 12 hours a day, every day. Plus commutes to the two jobs, you are out of home 13 to 14 hours. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876213&lt;br&gt;99% larpers, 1% get caught after on-boarding period&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876139&lt;br&gt;Other than fast food, I doubt people who work 80 hour weeks even have time to spend their money on bullshit. They probably just shower and collapse to bed at the end of the day. My bet is that they are paying a mortgage or have an incapacitated spouse or parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877899&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;if the US is in recession, why did Doordash just have it&amp;#x27;s biggest ever jump in orders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878363&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869517&lt;br&gt;I cant imagine working more than 50 hours a week, tf is wrong with americans? Working 70 hours a week to buy an oilguzzler to commute to work? Living in the sterile suburbs? Tossing a coin everytime a negro passes you on the street? What is even the point of all that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878371&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872563&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880061&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877899&lt;br&gt;People can&amp;#x27;t afford cars, and there&amp;#x27;s a decline in driver&amp;#x27;s license applications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Increased senior population demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880092&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878363&lt;br&gt;to enrich uncle sam at the small cost of every waking minute of your life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880116&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878363&lt;br&gt;I work 100+ hours plus just to not get evicted by my corporate landlord. My rent is $4,000 a month. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boomers here opose affordable housing because it&amp;#x27;s gonna hurt their home values. But fuck me I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880131&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878363&lt;br&gt;Forgot screenshot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880323&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;What a perfect moment for the Democrats to rule against receiving free money from the rest of the world because we are all pinky friends and we all love each other&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Pro Trump post in a fag infested board&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880323&lt;br&gt;Explain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>BAT — 26 replies — 39.8/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875908</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875908?lm=1771619511</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 20:31:51 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;BAT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875908'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 26 • Updated: 2026-02-20 20:31 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;markets are all fucked&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;global recession &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nobody is hiring &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;STILL holding 340k of this SHIT&lt;br&gt;The fuck am I even doing bros?

Why should they then get money back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879368&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The truth is that the tariff costs were pushed off onto other countries. All of our prices here in canada went up even though we don&amp;#x27;t have any new tariffs on shit because companies doing business in both countries just raised their prices here to offset their costs in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879378&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879239&lt;br&gt;I like free money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879432&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879211&lt;br&gt;I voted for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879539&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879221&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879211&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Leftists under tariffs &amp;quot;Uhhhh tariffs are le bad because YOU are the one paying for them! Trump is Le bad!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Liberals off of tariffs &amp;quot;Haha look tariffs are ILLEGAL now you get your money back. But that comes out of the revenue we got! (Which we didn&amp;#x27;t talk about as being good before) So it&amp;#x27;s le bad! Drumpf awful!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879599&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879539&lt;br&gt;Prices are coming down on cheap shit whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879685&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879211&lt;br&gt;Guess which tribe was buying up discounted refund claims before the ruling (including Howard Lutnick)? Trump insiders just transferred shit tons of tariff money to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879727&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879280&lt;br&gt;Why should the average American get a refund when they voted for this nonsense? We should refund the tariffs to the countries we imposed them on as reparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879763&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879221&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Americans are the ones who are owed that money.&lt;br&gt;Unless it&amp;#x27;s a small business willing to refund you or you paid the mailer yourself, all that money is being kept by the companies you bought from most likely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879870&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to pay it all back miggers, every single cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879904&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oops! Trump just reinstated Tariffs! Too bad!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879933&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879899&lt;br&gt;To be fair, Trump himself has said there&amp;#x27;s well over 150 billion tariffs revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879211&lt;br&gt;usdebtclock.org is a fantasy page. The numbers on that page have a very tenuous relation to reality. Total tariff revenue in calendar year 2025 was $264B.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess they must be optimistically projecting future tariff revenue - which seems difficult, since tariffs would likely continue to suppress imports. Monthly tariff revenue was already in decline in late 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see they&amp;#x27;ve removed the DOGE savings counter - I guess the fantasy numbers were becoming too much of an embarassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880158&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879211&lt;br&gt;Gonna have to wait for 5 years after paying a lawyer and going through the courts, sorry about that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880574&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;jokes on you, im paying that to MYSELF plus tax. and tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I have recently discovered leftwing finance youtube channels The whole things is never EVER blaming people for going int… — 53 replies — 20.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872693</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872693?lm=1771612361</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 18:32:41 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;I have recently discovered leftwing finance youtube channels The whole things is never EVER blaming people for going int…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872693'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 53 • Updated: 2026-02-20 18:32 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered leftwing finance youtube channels &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole things is never EVER blaming people for going into debt, but blaming companies instead&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Asking people how much debt they are in is Chud behaviour, just because they are in debt doesn&amp;#x27;t mean they can&amp;#x27;t go on a vacation, but Disneyland should be cheaper, Disney is predatory&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;The problem isn&amp;#x27;t credit card debt, that&amp;#x27;s normal, the problem is how hight the interests rates are&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;60k car loans are insane but really, why do the cars need to cost that much?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872704&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;The one you used in the OP got famous for calling people retards to their faces for their debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872721&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;Caleb is just a gay zoomer Dave Ramsey.

That leaves you alone, in the system, to &amp;quot;cope&amp;quot;. How will you do that? By reading the rules and bending them enough to make you prosperous within its confines.

Hmmm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879588&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872722&lt;br&gt;Yeah except he&amp;#x27;s basically a pinko moderate besides the fact that he&amp;#x27;s come to the common sense realization that most poor people are poor because they&amp;#x27;re clearly obviously fucking retards making bad decisions. He&amp;#x27;s clearly pretty pozzed with regards to gays, &amp;quot;sex workers&amp;quot;, being unmarried with kids, thruples, etc. in the typical Reddit &amp;quot;you do you frendo&amp;quot; with his only standard being whether or not that happens to be producing outcomes the person doing them likes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Far right&amp;quot; is a faggot term for &amp;quot;conservative&amp;quot; to try to make it sound bad. You&amp;#x27;ll see very very little discussion of merely right wing in leftist media. &amp;quot;Far right&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;something I don&amp;#x27;t like&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Poor people are poor largely because they deserve it, they&amp;#x27;re not oppressed victims and therefore we&amp;#x27;re not terribly obligated to do much of anything just because they&amp;#x27;re irresponsible&amp;quot; is just one of the most basic conservative ideas. But it&amp;#x27;s entirely antithetical to a leftist world view that basically identifies everyone as either victims and victimizers and that rustled Jimmies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879764&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879349&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Conservatives are generally already better with money because they had fiscally responsible parents&lt;br&gt;You need to look at the latest data. Conservative core base are the people of walmart who don&amp;#x27;t marry, spend recklessly, and leech off the government. They&amp;#x27;re basically white niggers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the responsible Romney type republicans left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879795&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879764&lt;br&gt;Just the same they fundamentally believe people have self-responsibility even if they hypocritically are fuckups living on gibs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879802&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879764&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;political people I don&amp;#x27;t like bad, poor, stupid&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;political people I do like good, rich, smart&lt;br&gt;Sure thing buddy. &lt;br&gt;So anyways conservatives are generally more fiscally literate people and don&amp;#x27;t rack up lots of retarded debt because they come from better homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879795&lt;br&gt;I swear all you leftist who believe this shit come from single wide trailer parks and just hate your own upbringing and project it on everyone you disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>He is right — 39 replies — 16.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61877610</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61877610?lm=1771613154</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 18:45:54 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;He is right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61877610'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 39 • Updated: 2026-02-20 18:45 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anon who has been telling us to get out of US stocks might be on to something&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877621&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;america is dying&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;put your money into europe (dead continent)&lt;br&gt;investors are retarded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877621&lt;br&gt;Poor lil igor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877668&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877659&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_fertility_rate&lt;br&gt;List the 2025 fertility rates in ascending order.

It feels infinite, especially after all the QE, but there are no dollars &amp;#x27;locked up&amp;#x27; in stocks. Someone is physically holding those dollars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the mindset changes, suddenly the liquidity is gone. The rug is pulled.

I instantly know there is a schizo take coming when i read this. Some schizo takes are interesting, some are even good, some are good to think through and some are just funny to read. But they stzill are schizo takes and mostly bullshit influeces too much by wish bias. So how and where did this phrase pick up with schizos. When i know, its around 2021/2022 when the schizo&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;economy will collapse and people will starve due to lockdowns&lt;br&gt;did not materialize. Then they started with this phrase to somehow save their prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873806&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no less than three seething replies about muh real capitalism&lt;br&gt;If you abolished the state it would be reinvented by the wealthy overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;Fake and gay was in use when I 1st started using this site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873988&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Hopefully never because I have a fake overpaid job, just not in HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876439&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872064&lt;br&gt;And prevent White women from breeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877263&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;everyone wants to be rich without doing jack shit, jews are just more succesful at the game and more honest about what the game is, maybe because they invented it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there are less and less people talking about &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;value&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in a real way, no one believes in it, no one believes that value is real or there is merit to providing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;everything is about winning or losing, and brother let me tell you, I&amp;#x27;m not gonna be one of the cucks who focuses on helping society or building when I can make my money sitting in my computer and playing the money game, the money game is more fun and rewarding than going to medical or engineering school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;go in to interview for a technical role&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;see vidrel being filmed in the hallway on your way in&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the job pays well&lt;br&gt;wat do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872085&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872087&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872278&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;REAL capitalism has never been tried&lt;br&gt;This is real capitalism, and it&amp;#x27;s retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878294&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Because human beings(the goyim) is just another resources that the &amp;#x27;choosen ones&amp;#x27; can exploid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878310&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877287&lt;br&gt;call them a bunch of FAG KIKE TRANNIES and instead get a based n&amp;#x27; trad job shoveling horse shit for $14.35/hour with no health insurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878355&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878294&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;human beings&lt;br&gt;its the best asset you can own, they work, (produce free goods) they pay taxes(fake money holds value), they eat poison food and get sick, then forced to consume overpriced drugs(more profits), there is no stock that can make better return over lifetime and asset(the goy) is free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878449&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Why is are Schizos always using that phrase?&lt;br&gt;In zoomer lingo, it&amp;#x27;s copium. They are losers who can&amp;#x27;t cut it. Naturally, they are not the problem and anyone who does great in the current system is cheating (hence fake and gay).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These types would be losers under any system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878715&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871931&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They don’t actually do nothing &lt;br&gt;These retarded whores are of no value to society work force.&lt;br&gt;They can not weld , machine, approve engineering drawings or balance the company finances or protect them f taxes.&lt;br&gt;All they do is prevent men from building modern day Rome.&lt;br&gt;Go back to plebbit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878722&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Are they dancing because nobody replied to their emails and they have nothing to do or are they bragging about not replying to emails?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878715&lt;br&gt;If they didn&amp;#x27;t provide value they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be there. The reality is that HR prevents the company from getting sued out of existence. If you want to hate HR, that is valid but just know that hate should be reflected to the legal system that allows for the company to be sued. Yes they prevent men from being men and are only there to protect women&amp;#x27;s feelings but guess what women&amp;#x27;s feelings are what the legal system is currently based on with shit like abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>why would anyone live here — 87 replies — 11.3/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797?lm=1771594242</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 13:30:42 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;why would anyone live here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 87 • Updated: 2026-02-20 13:30 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;i recently moved to NYC to work for a &amp;quot;lucrative salary&amp;quot; (not really, because this place drains you of all your income) and after working here for 4 months i dont know why anyone would willingly live here&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the entire city smells like rotting shit, cigarette buds and dead animals, not a faint smell, an extremely strong odor that you&amp;#x27;ll eventually just become nose blind to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;homeless people, fucking everywhere, when i left my apartment there were homeless people sleeping in the hallways of my complex, when you go on walk there are homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk with a PILLOW and BLANKET while regular people walk over them like this is just some normal fucking occurrence (and in this shithole it is) never ever have i seen some shit like this even in the worst of cities ive lived in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;heroin needles, weed bags, cigarette buds &amp;amp; the occasional dildo just scattered across the city sidewalks, your constantly walking over human shit, broken bottles or dime bags&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rats and rodents EVERYWHERE. il never forget the time i bought a pizza from one of the disgusting street vendors and when i sat down at a table one of the rats were circling my feet trying to climb my leg for a bite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the &amp;quot;public transport&amp;quot; system is a just permanent housing for the mentally ill, every time i had to ride the subway i was scared for my life because of all the fucking looneys that inhabit the train systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is just off the top of my head, but i think the biggest mindfuck of it all is that its EXPENSIVE to live here its gonna cost you not 50k, not 100k, not 200k, to live comfortably by yourself you need 250K yearly in manhattan. 250k, to live among violent homeless people, 250k to constantly have to walk in rotting shit and roadkill. 250k to have your ears blown out by car horns &amp;amp; niggerbabble, 250k to be forced to smell the most putried scents imaginable i dont know why anyone sane would live here, this place is some sort of social experiment, some sort of anonmoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Go back to your trailer park, pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872853&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;You know the phrase &amp;quot;If you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re not making it.

It&amp;#x27;s for the rich. Who are cut from the other, traveling with chauffered car. &lt;br&gt;The rent will drain all your earnings. &lt;br&gt;In 2020, they transformed Jew york hospitals into death camps (dyor on this). &lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a city of madness. It&amp;#x27;s the madness of our world in crisis, but concentrated. &lt;br&gt;It is a successor of Babylon, Alexandria, etc... &lt;br&gt;Stay away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877846&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DUDE i just LOVE the hustle and bustle of the big city, it’s so DYNAMIC and makes me feel like i’m in one of my favourite TV SHOWS. you should totally come on down to my studio apartment, it’s got EXPOSED RED BRICK walls and 50 square feet! we can crack open a nice hoppy ipa or three and get crazy watching some cartoons on adult swim! and dude, dude, DUDE, we have GOTTA go down to the barcade- listen here, right, it’s a BAR where us ADULTS who do ADULTING can go DRINK. BUT!!!! it’s also an ARCADE like when we were kids, so we can play awesome VIDEO GAMES, without dumb kids bothering us. speaking of which megan and i have finally decided to tie the knot- literally -we’re both getting snipped tomorrow at the hospital, that way we can save money to spent more on ourselves and our FURBABIES. i’m fuckin JACKED man, i’m gonna SLAM this craft beer and pop open another one!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;whine&amp;quot; in ID&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;whines&lt;br&gt;Never been to NYC, never will go. Happy in my small town, simple as.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872887&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;So much propaganda and people think it&amp;#x27;s the best city in the world&lt;br&gt;If you are a jew or a degenerate perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878027&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872934&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Beautiful women outnumber eligible men.&lt;br&gt;You mean crazy roasties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878028&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876952&lt;br&gt;I’m never going to visit Jew York you stupid cocksucking faggot. Unless it’s to fuck your whore mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878030&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872950&lt;br&gt;Actually, AIDS do not exist. NOr does any viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878056&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876813&lt;br&gt;kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878093&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877838&lt;br&gt;It’s not some modern Babylon, that’s my whole point. It has a relatively tame and uninspired party scene compared to some european cities, it’s women are majorly brown ect. It’s just a pretty boring third world city with big history, but doesn’t offer much in modernity besides the amazing skyscraper architechture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878125&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Why would you live in a globalist shit hole? You were desperately warned about these people. So we genuinely do not know who is stupider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>You expect me to believe — 6 replies — 10.5/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61879837</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61879837?lm=1771619809</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 20:36:49 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;You expect me to believe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61879837'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 6 • Updated: 2026-02-20 20:36 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;that we are pumping for 2 weeks because no tariffs? &lt;br&gt;Then I suppose we dump because WWIII?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879917&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;more like fart of the deal lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879917&lt;br&gt;This Anon thought he was clever.

Maybe it is slightly easier in America but that seems to be fading quickly now that the post war era is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877363&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t invest in the United States, bobo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877634&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877358&lt;br&gt;Looking by wealth distribution, USA isn&amp;#x27;t a first world country. It has just has a wealthy upper class and a super wealthy elite class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877638&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;But anyways yeah bobo i know, that&amp;#x27;s why invest in european markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874572&lt;br&gt;Not only that, I voted for it too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877708&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874572&lt;br&gt;Only if you are investing in index funds.&lt;br&gt;You can choose to invest in what you love about this country.&lt;br&gt;I personally am investing in LMT, GD, HAL, XOM, BX, COST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877733&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877708&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m sure that Black Rock doesn&amp;#x27;t own any of those stocks and enforcing DEI. They probably pay people enough to live off of and aren&amp;#x27;t looking to automate. Corporate culture surely hasn&amp;#x27;t infiltrated those businesses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can I interest you in a Rolex watch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877891&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;By investing in US stocks, I am hedging against everything I love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877903&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877686&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;sometimes Cherri gets horny at work, dances and has sex with the men in the closests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878643&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874572&lt;br&gt;I finance shit that literally kill people because it gives me divvies. Do you think I care in the slightest for normalfags? They are cattle to be milked dry. I hate wokeslop and yet I invested in NFLX after it dropped. To this day I never subbed to them and seed torrents of shows from there. I hate cigarettes and yet I invest in MO. I don&amp;#x27;t believe in crypto and yet I got back in BTC around 69k. I believe in socialized healthcare and yet I&amp;#x27;m a UNH baggie (avg over $300)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874623&lt;br&gt;I can profit in white Genocide?
