It was supposed to be private money. It was subverted while Epstein&amp;#x27;s MIT lab had majority control over it for a majority of its code build and now it is unscalable and unusable without scaling into shitty, INSANELY centralized L2 end services that are retardedly expensive and slow when better technologies with more functionality that are actually decentralized and have privacy capabilities can scale at L1. Namely the ones Epstein messaged opposing in his emails and then lobbied Gensler to go after when he conditioned him for Chairman of the SEC, XRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876034&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;i think moore&amp;#x27;s law was already dead when bitcoin started&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876068&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875503&lt;br&gt;Moore&amp;#x27;s law is dead.

Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870682&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870203&lt;br&gt;ah, i see, you are retarded. just because some laws that are lax exist doesn&amp;#x27;t mean data is protected, you fucking retarded faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870744&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870065&lt;br&gt;it started long before post-WW2 tho, germs bureaucracymaxxed post-reunification during the 2nd Reich, from 1871 onward.&lt;br&gt;At first it was to keep in check all the landers trying to take the lion&amp;#x27;s share of federal credits and centralize power. And it worked gud, but then it progressively became the hellscape kafkaian machine we all know.&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s how you know the hallofcost never happened, becuz you can be sure nazis would have made endless paperworks addressing the situation, down to the very last jewish pubic hair, but we didn&amp;#x27;t find any document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop eating the commie propaganda. Europeans don&amp;#x27;t have savings for shit, they just have stable expenses but all their wealth is tied to inheriting homes. That&amp;#x27;s why homes are basically untaxed while stocks are treated like financial Nazism. You aren&amp;#x27;t going to spend more a healthy young person in the US, the real benefit of Europe is the private healthcare is very cheap and good &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting businesses in Europe sucks because of two factors. The first is low liquidity and consumer spending: unlike the US, people don&amp;#x27;t spend nearly as much, have as much to spend, or make debt. So there isn&amp;#x27;t much room for anyone to buy something new - successful businesses target liquid tourists or B2B, where they write off the huge taxes as expenses. Over regulated financial market also leads to lower liquidity and more difficulty getting loans and investors, you rely on government programs run by middle aged menopausal cunts that have never worked more than 28 hours a week &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other issue is labor laws and public perception. It&amp;#x27;s morally bankrupt to try and get more money, why aren&amp;#x27;t you happy being average, why are you trying to pull ahead. Anyone you hire can&amp;#x27;t be fired, you can&amp;#x27;t have low compensation with offset packages to get high skill labor, you need to suck some blue blooded cock to get money and not wait years for whatever permits you&amp;#x27;ll need, because they were born out of nobility and still have half the money and connections &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eurotards freak out about Epstein but every European politician and rich person rapes babies for breakfast. It&amp;#x27;s just 1) not pedo to them if they&amp;#x27;re over 14 bc muh age of consent and 2) they hide in the shadows unlike Americans, they try to be as unnoticed as possible, give a few concessions to the poor and continue ruling sucking and fucking like they&amp;#x27;ve been doing the past thousand years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870889&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870103&lt;br&gt;What are the reforms that boomers are blocking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870915&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869942&lt;br&gt;Yeah i feel the same. Sex, drugs and love are already the ultimate sensations and none of them are expensive. All luxuries are pretty worthless add-ons and don’t feel special. You just have a bigger bed, or a bigger car, not anything you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870937&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s complete bullshit, stop making up fantasies in your mind. If there is ONE thing still somewhat running smoothly in western Europe, it&amp;#x27;s free healthcare.&lt;br&gt;Contrary to you i know what i&amp;#x27;m talking about since i was on the operation table just a month ago to fix few lower vertebrae after a bike accident. I never had to wait for anything more than few days, nor did i have to spend a single penny on pre-procedures, examinations or for the hospital stay/operation/anesthesia/post-op medication. And i don&amp;#x27;t have any health mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It probably would have costed me a bazillion goybux in the jewSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870937&lt;br&gt;Why the fuck would it cost bajillions, even shit insurance has a max out of pocket of like 10k. If you don&amp;#x27;t have a job medicaid literally covers everything for free, the real problem is half the people that qualify are too fucking stupid to sign up for it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also if the accident wasn&amp;#x27;t your fault you could sue for big money, in Europe they&amp;#x27;re just like meh accidents happen enjoy the lifelong complications faggot. I will agree southern European health systems are pretty decent and their private healthcare is fantastic and cheap, but if you&amp;#x27;re German or some shit I&amp;#x27;d rather have the US system, you guys pay more in healthcare tax than any American if you have a half decent job and if you get anything where you may actually die they just say, yeah you&amp;#x27;re fucked settle your affairs or the bureaucracy will give the rest of your family a stroke, no point trying any more it&amp;#x27;s an inefficient allocation of resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;This is extremely short-sighted of them, they will end up losing the capacity to compete and fall behind slowly, they actually already are, then when they slowly go on closing business left and right from ever increasing ineficiency. What else can they even do but borrow more and more for the worst possible spending a state can do, paying bills, a budget blackhole, increasing inflation and making money useless and as those countries get poorer the services will also get far far far worse and extremely corrupt, not even talking about how such aging will make it even worse. Honestly this is reading like what happened to argentina, greece and other latam and thirdies socialist govts did, it will work fine as long as the economy can keep it, when it starts to shrink it will be poverty hell. I will agree that america treats us workers pretty bad, but this welfare paradise of the EU won&amp;#x27;t work for long either, they will end up forced to cut things and get closer to us if they want to survive a world with China, India, US and former colonies being no longer mudhutts but mildly developed enough to make raw resources more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Lots of retards ITT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Setting up a business is child&amp;#x27;s play in places like Denmark, Sweden, Estonia. Setting up, doing tax returns and all interactions with gov is handled through online ID and takes seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Places like Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia are selling themselves as business friendly. Very low taxes. Some places like Bulgaria have extremely low dividend taxes so you pay yourself with dividends. Romania has a corporate setup where you pay a tiny percentage on the turnover. Ideal for freelancers or small business with high margins or just extreme low expense. In all of these places, corporate setups and accountants cost next to nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you have some almost offshore jurisdictions still in the EU with insanely beneficial rules for some niches and very low taxes. Like Cyprus and Malta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now regulations, what regulations? Anything (except guns, booze, some gambling, cigarettes I guess) is traded freely between the states under the same legislation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also: we get sued way less over here. Do the math on that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871050&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; wife started selling her paintings&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; she declared herself first, this was needed to attend some events&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; French government instantly asks her for €800, before she has made her first sale&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; this is what they estimate she&amp;#x27;d owe them at the end of the year based on their estimates of how much she will earn, so they ask for it upfront&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you can contest it but it&amp;#x27;s actually faster to wait for the year to end so they are proven wrong&lt;br&gt;I hate them so much...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871051&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;taxes&lt;br&gt;depends where, some places will legit rape your revenue&lt;br&gt;Combined with some insane regulations and you legit can&amp;#x27;t start a company&lt;br&gt;Best example is France, fucked up taxes, and if you want to get into tech, or anything that involves personal data, you need cough up 6 to 7 figures so that your cyber security is in the norm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;I will die long before I see some high tech company or even mid tier industry appear in latam, africa or even india, they will always be turning up cheap raw resources because they are simply brown subhumans with low iq, not even talking about russia post-war. Its an unfounded fearmongering that we will ever have to compete with them lol, you forget europe will never fall to thirdie level of mismanagement simple because we are better educated and white. At the very worst unlikely scenario we will always make money from tourism anyway, but honestly this is all american envy for no reason, we are not stopping you from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871116&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871023&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re admitting you can only live off arbitrage? Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria, Romania is actually marginally based because it&amp;#x27;s spread its asshole to US companies for cheap EU labor, those Nordic countries you listed have a smaller economy than Pennsylvania so yeah if you want to sell troon support stickers you&amp;#x27;re good but you&amp;#x27;re not going to make shit otherwise &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portugal is also kind of based but it fully relies on US and other European investments, as well as inexistent enforcement of labor laws and pathetic salaries. I don&amp;#x27;t get how you&amp;#x27;d start up there without the first 100k being gifted though, or the family having land, or working abroad first &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire opening a bakery or car wash or hamster fentanyl university of arts like the US, there&amp;#x27;s no consumer spending to eat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871180&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire&lt;br&gt;Lmao, just look at economic charts, most european economies have high tech industry as the main economic activity, american bullshit as usual, nobody needs to be a millionaire in europe, we already live better than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria,&lt;br&gt;As I said, you are a fucking retard. Your company is in Bulgaria, but you sell to fucking anyone in EU the same way while paying insanely low corporate tax and next to no admin fees. You ship from anywhere you want in the EU, or have staff in bloody Manila if you wish. What the fuck does that have to do with arbitrage? You incorporate wherever you want since it is your legal right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doubt you are entrepreneurial material though, so do not bother grokking the potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871000&lt;br&gt;The suing thing is the biggest AIDS of USA. People are already well compensated enough in europe for their troubles. The ”if you make a honest mistake, someone will see their opportinity and sue you and financially destroy your life” mentality just creates even more stress to an already high stress environment of USA. It just makes people act even more legally defensive at every turn and creates useless bureucracy and slows things down. Getting raped when everything didn’t go 100% nicely is not something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;This is the most midwit take and the reason why USA is failing now (it has become a nation of midwits due to poor public education). People have been saying this for decades but right now europe is in a bullrun while USA has been becoming an oligarchic brasil since the 80s. Clearly socialism doesn&amp;#x27;t just lead to inefficiency but instead to more efficiency for all instead of just few hoarding the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871353&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871183&lt;br&gt;Learn to read Fritz, you are saying what I&amp;#x27;m saying while sounding like a mong. You&amp;#x27;re setting up in poor countries to sell to richer countries&amp;#x27; businesses while using the common market, it&amp;#x27;s geographic arbitrage you sausage guzzling troon, and you&amp;#x27;re selling to businesses. All that free education and you&amp;#x27;re still poorer than a fucking car salesman in Pensacola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871500&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871214&lt;br&gt;What? Excluding Pooland all major eu economies have stopped growing or deacelerated fast, people were saying it for decades with reason, if it wasnt for a miraculous fall of the ussr and a flood of cheap raw resources and energy with negligible transport costs from russia it would&amp;#x27;ve happened earlier as it did post-2008 when europe started to lag more and more behind the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867554&lt;br&gt;Nigger&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;give us taxes goy&lt;br&gt;ok, well, how much&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;We don&amp;#x27;t know uwu&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you tell us&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but if you&amp;#x27;re wrong we get to take even more of your money lol&lt;br&gt;you just said you don&amp;#x27;t know what I owe&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thats right &lt;br&gt;so how do you know if I pay wrong?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Don&amp;#x27;t get cheeky with us you little shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871570&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871500&lt;br&gt;That guy is fucking retarded why even argue. The average European is still a moron, printing useless degrees doesn&amp;#x27;t make people smarter. They still cuck themselves daily. He&amp;#x27;s happy to never own anything so his blue blooded friends can hoard the land and wealth like they&amp;#x27;ve always done &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Muh healthcare muh taxes &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half of every country is too fucking poor to pay tax, and the top 10% isn&amp;#x27;t stupid enough to pay tax, so the middle class just pays 50% of their income while being happy they can rent a shit hole for life and that they&amp;#x27;re better off unemployed than working in terms of life quality &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will definitely return to Europe once my nest egg is built, I&amp;#x27;ll just live in 2 different countries 179 days a year and live off US divvies therefore paying no retard tax and just paying private healthcare out of pocket, or if I really make it just pay the flat 100k Italian tax and get private insurance for 300 a month that will pay for top quality coverage while I sip Italian wines and hire high end eastern european hookers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871624&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871570&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can’t get women otherwise so has to pay for hookers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for revealing that you’re some dysfunctional weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871681&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871624&lt;br&gt;Thanks for showing why you&amp;#x27;re weak, religious morals won&amp;#x27;t get you anywhere.

They don&amp;#x27;t give a fuck as long as the currency&amp;#x27;s worth approximately the same amount in between signing the contract and payment being issued&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874936&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874905&lt;br&gt;I do broadly agree, however if it looks like a country is going to debt-nuke the whole world you have to take some action at some point. The US is just as likely to shit the world economy as china is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874965&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874899&lt;br&gt;Their currency is currently undervalued by roughly 16% and they actively manage its strength. How do you think they have such a ridiculous surplus? .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874965&lt;br&gt;No they keep it tied to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875001&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874974&lt;br&gt;They have one of the most opaque central banks in the world. Nobody outside of China has any idea how they determine their exchange rate. It’s not hard to see the benefits they gain from keeping it low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875052&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875001&lt;br&gt;Trump admin:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;NO! NO! NO! Only WE&amp;#x27;RE allowed to devalue our currency because WE need WAGESLAVES more than YOU! Y..you can&amp;#x27;t just print to build infrastructure!!! That&amp;#x27;s communist!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875074&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875052&lt;br&gt;I think the euros are more upset with china’s devaluation than America is. The guy in that article complaining is German. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re instantiating a levy on small goods in July to combat the yuan that refuses to budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875077&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875001&lt;br&gt;How it&amp;#x27;s done? They just keep it tied to the dollar. What are you talking about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875121&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875077&lt;br&gt;It isn’t strictly tied to the dollar. It WAS before 2005, but now it’s a managed float system that is managed by the central bank. The dollar plays a big role, but it isn’t as if the yuan keeps strict pace with the dollar. They can (and do) manage its exchange rate. Exactly how they determine what the exchange rate should be is the opaque part. One way they manage the yuan’s value is by buying/selling dollars with their currency, and this is one reason why the keep so many dollars in reserve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is also why, earlier in the thread, I argued that the dollar’s role as a reference point for a currency can still cause it to be accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875124&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;Sour fucking grapes. The Jews running the west are such idiots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875149&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875074&lt;br&gt;Germans don&amp;#x27;t even believe in debt, they had a rule in their constitution that they couldn&amp;#x27;t borrow more than 0.35% of GDP annually until 2025 when shit hit the fan for needing to build a real military.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Reee we aren&amp;#x27;t taking on debt so you can&amp;#x27;t either reeee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875160&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873120&lt;br&gt;They’re disgusting gook bugmen that are not human&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875205&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874965&lt;br&gt;A currency cannot be &amp;quot;undervalued&amp;quot;, because there is no &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;inherent&amp;quot; value for a currency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China keeps its currency stable relative to other currencies, mainly USD, to avoid currency exchange risk for exporting and importing companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China has a ridiculous surplus because (a) Chinese companies are ridiculously competitive, (b) Chinese companies are not allowed to import the kind of things they want to import because of export controls, (c) Chinese companies are afraid an over-dependence on imports will lead to them being rug-pulled by new export controls or piracy, and (d) the CPC has a &amp;quot;minimize China&amp;#x27;s dependence on others, maximize others&amp;#x27; dependence on China&amp;quot; philosophy on how to win trade wars and avoid shooting wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875302&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875205&lt;br&gt;Just because there isn’t an underlying physical commodity to back the currency doesn’t mean that the currency can’t still be undervalued (or overvalued). Parity for currencies, even currencies in a fiat system, is one way that this is calculated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a basket of various goods in the US goes for 100 dollars and that same basket of goods in Vietnam goes for 10 dollars (ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL), then a fair exchange rate would be 10 dong for one dollar. This is one way that these are calculated—people look at prices for similar goods, adjust for import and other costs, and determine how much that currency can actually purchase. When a country sets their own exchange rate, even if partially like in china’s case, it’s possible to undervalue it. They have an incentive to claim that their currency is weaker than it actually is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, no, that simply isn’t true. I know what you’re trying to say—fiat money has no intrinsic value—but it doesn’t mean that it can’t be undervalued or overvalued relative to other currencies. There’s a reason why economists or even someone casually interested in the economy and trade policy use these terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875322&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875149&lt;br&gt;Reparations absolutely traumatized Germans in terms of their willingness to take on debt lol. They’ll have to do some serious heavy lifting in the EU soon, so I imagine they’ll start taking some more on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875497&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875322&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s already happened, they got rid of the limit and are doomping into their infrastructure and military&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873712&lt;br&gt;kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875517&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874965&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;How do you think they have such a ridiculous surplus?&lt;br&gt;by being better than others at everything that matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875527&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LMAO. Expecting Chinese to stop subsidising their industry is akin to asking Americans to stop eating Burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875528&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875497&lt;br&gt;Huh no kidding, I hadn’t been paying much attention to that. One thing I will be keeping an eye on is the EU pension crisis and how that’s managed because I personally don’t see a smooth exit from that situation, especially in France. Looking into it, I guess Germany has a similar problem, which I wouldn’t have guessed based on their debt. What’s your take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875121&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s between 6 and 8 Yuan so it&amp;#x27;s still tied to the dollar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875517&lt;br&gt;Well, my point was that by managing the currency in order to keep it low, it makes exports more attractive, which results in a huge surplus. If the yuan floated freely, this would eventually correct. A huge trade surplus would mean more demand for the yuan and it would strengthen the currency. However, China doesn’t let this happen. If the currency strengthens or threatens to strengthen beyond what they deem desirable, they weaken their currency by selling yuan or by setting a lower daily exchange rate. This is the advantage of a managed currency, but it also means that it pisses everyone off when their own exports aren’t as competitive or their domestic industries suffer. China claims that they don’t this to the extent that they’re accused of, and it definitely comes in waves of egregiousness, but it seems like they’re back at it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, it’s true they’re good at exporting, but their insane trade surplus is in part the result of what I’m describing (an undervalued yuan that is kept undervalued by china’s central bank).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875564&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873590&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;call western &amp;quot;social democracies&amp;quot; capitalist&lt;br&gt;We are 10 times more communist than china... with an extra helping of suicidal democracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875527&lt;br&gt;China doesn&amp;#x27;t subsidize their industries though&lt;br&gt;They just do things better and have more affordable standards of living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875583&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873819&lt;br&gt;Wtf I love China now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875617&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875554&lt;br&gt;It can be undervalued and tied to the dollar. Read my post. You seem to think that because a currency’s exchange rate hasn’t changed that it can’t be undervalued or overvalued. That’s not true. Its real value in terms of purchasing power could rise and the central bank could artificially exert downward pressure (which would mean that the exchange rate would stay roughly the same over time). This is exactly what China has been accused of forever, and the issue is that China issue exactly forthcoming with their economic data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is obviously tied to the dollar. It is not STRICTLY PEGGED to the dollar. Every day the PBOC sets the exchange rate. The argument is that this rate hasn’t changed and has remained too low for how much demand there is for the yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875625&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875528&lt;br&gt;Well they&amp;#x27;re definitely going to bail the pension system out, but it should be kind of mitigated by the military and infrastructure spending because of their domestic industry. Adding money to those sectors should hypothetically cause more younger people to make more money, increasing direct contributions to the pension system. The bet that they&amp;#x27;re taking is that the spending won&amp;#x27;t increase inflation as much as it will improve the economic situation, which has some merit because Germany and even the rest of the EU have considerably lower debt to GDP than China or the US, and the currency has been appreciating broadly over the past few years giving them room for increased spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875629&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875572&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of them are subsidised. They do not call them as subsidies but different names. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: Ran a Business sourcing products from multiple suppliers in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875657&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873690&lt;br&gt;A communist dictator that values his people and his country will absolutely make any system built on jewish corruption look bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875675&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875625&lt;br&gt;Interesting, good take. Definitely a situation to watch, particularly how the bailout happens. Getting a handle on youth unemployment, especially in France, should help, yeah. Realistically, I wonder if the pension system will be continued for much longer moving forward, and I think the French will lose their shit if it’s reformed in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Can we collectively decide to pump ROSE please? — 9 replies — 15.6/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875510</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875510?lm=1771540868</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:41:08 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Can we collectively decide to pump ROSE please?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875510'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 9 • Updated: 2026-02-19 22:41 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you call me a retarded bag holder and that this is a dead coin (I am and am aware), I&amp;#x27;ve seen you deranged retards come together for some miraculous feats for more impractical shit than this.

Is it because 4chuds are high inhib pussy incels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871884&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is in 2014, 2017, 2021 you could take 10,000 bucks and buy basically anything and a 10x was guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember taking 2021 for granted lol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2024 bull run saw an initial pump from alts from january to april and then htey just bled from april to september, then bled again from december to may, and from may 2025 to present the bulk of alts bled out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember seeing microstrategy and I was like &amp;quot;gonna buy that when bitcoin goes back to 50k&amp;quot;. Then I saw MSTX. Hell yeah, double your money for each MSTR move, and MSTR was double bitcoin. A run to 100k from 50k would be an easy 8x. And it was. But I sold before the election and fumbled it. The fumbler. It&amp;#x27;s easy to create a perfect plan in your mind, and watch it play out exactly as you said it would, but it takes a lot of conviction to not fuck it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now most markets are way up. 2026, 2022, 2018, midterm years have slow market growth. The time to buy it was 2023, the time to make it was 2024, the time to swap into alts like KTA and HYPE and AVANTIS was 2025. I called everything correctly but fucked up the one thing that mattered- buying, and holding to a 10x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871780&lt;br&gt;Boomers love driving big SUVs for some reason. Makes them &amp;quot;feel safe&amp;quot; or some shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872189&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Bug people, soulless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Because they are literally lower quality organisms. Same reason no one gives a fuck when you kill a fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873614&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863924&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I would just like to know if all that crap about satan, moloch worship, demons, etc., it&amp;#x27;s just like a game because they simply like to eat and torture babies or do those entities really exist.&lt;br&gt;Nah but they believe in it. Very powerful people ironically fear death a lot so they somehow believe this can save them from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873616&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864738&lt;br&gt;They fear China the most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873938&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;What a dumb retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873940&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868075&lt;br&gt;This was denied by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873942&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;He could have make it if he had better control of his brakes, I think he&amp;#x27;s one of these riders who only use the front brake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Vance — 6 replies — 12.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61874782</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61874782?lm=1771541160</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:46:00 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Vance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61874782'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 6 • Updated: 2026-02-19 22:46 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; JD VANCE SAID, “CHINA DOESN&amp;#x27;T LIKE BITCOIN.

It&amp;#x27;s a scheme that allows elite whales to cash out at the top. Fed money goes to Blackrock who buys mstr bonds. Mstr buys Bitcoin OTC from those in &amp;#x27;the club&amp;#x27;&lt;br&gt;There wouldn&amp;#x27;t be enough liquidity otherwise. &lt;br&gt;Noone actually buys mstr it&amp;#x27;s just an Epstein type operation to move money around and the goyim are too dumb to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873851&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saylor is well paid to launder funds through his “Bitcoin” management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875118&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873812&lt;br&gt;If mstr defaulted on those bonds BlackRock is going to be the biggest loser then since &amp;quot;noone actually buys mstr&amp;quot;. But I guess it won&amp;#x27;t hurt BlackRock portofolio if it really dropped to that point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe ~5-10% of mstr shareholders are genuine retail traders I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873670&lt;br&gt;Why aren&amp;#x27;t those bitcoins in his cup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875157&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873658&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;Are the longs cheap or still way overbought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875172&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873658&lt;br&gt;LOL&lt;br&gt;X10 is sure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875219&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;why is the mNAV &amp;gt; 1.0 to begin with? shouldn&amp;#x27;t it be &amp;lt; 1.0 since their value is basically btc_holdings - debt_obligations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;I hope this faggot&amp;#x27;s bluff gets called so bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875246&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;Holy based cyber hornets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the best thing to happen to crypto.

I make that much in a medium/low cost city in the Midwest and feel like I could use a lot more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you moved there for a career and only made that much then yeah I think you weren&amp;#x27;t anywhere close to making an optimal move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I&amp;#x27;m saying is you&amp;#x27;re a.) soft as fuck and b.) not nearly as intelligent or valuable as you think you are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;so? its jew york, its there to someone to nuke it.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873706&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;OP can&amp;#x27;t handle the hustle and bustle of NYC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873716&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;i heard there are more dating age women than men in nyc. so might be good if you&amp;#x27;re looking to SUCKNFUCK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873754&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873067&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;All I&amp;#x27;m saying is you&amp;#x27;re a.) soft as fuck and b.) not nearly as intelligent or valuable as you think you are&lt;br&gt;Go live there pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873892&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873754&lt;br&gt;fun fact &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873067 doesnt realize the inverse of &amp;quot;if you can make it in nyc you can make it anywhere&amp;quot; is the actual truth. there are people that cannot make it out of nyc. there is a huge swaths of the country where the only employer is dollar general paying $1-2/hr above minimum wage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;any retard can come to nyc and get a six figure job, and if they dont aspire to ever own property or live in a super trendy/high end part of the city they&amp;#x27;ll be fine. meanwhile if they stayed in florida or ohio or even suburban connecticut they probably would&amp;#x27;ve been stuck working retail or at best making $60,000 a year in a place where meals still cost $14-20 and gas is still $3 a gallon and his rent is still retarded high like $1800-2400/mo because nyc/la/boston set rental pricing for the rest of the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873895&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been to NYC and none of that happened to me howeverbeit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873906&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Heh sounds exactly like my experience as an euro whi visited the city two years ago. I got assaulted by some young negress 15 minutes after i had arrived in the city, two blocks from the times square. The whole place was worse than Brasil and indeed full of homeless and untreated schizophrenics. Felt like third world to an european like me. Really showed how much USA has decayed when it’s normal for them to live in dangerous third world cities like this. Paris was literal heaven compared to it. Everything was clean, almost zero homeless, immigrants were working the shit jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873913&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873895&lt;br&gt;the streets are pretty disgusting after a month of frozen snow finally melting im excited for the rain tomorrow &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873906&lt;br&gt;times square is a shithole thoughever&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its like me saying all of france is marseilles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873926&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873892&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;or at best making $60,000 a year in a place where meals still cost $14-20 and gas is still $3 a gallon and his rent is still retarded high like $1800-2400/mo because nyc/la/boston set rental pricing for the rest of the country&lt;br&gt;Fucking trvke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I live in Ohio making ~62k a year gross and gas prices are $2.90-$4.00 depending on the octane level you need, a meal is $25, a drink at a bar is $15, and rent in the ghetto is $1000-1200 for a studio, or $1500+ if you don&amp;#x27;t want to get shot. On top of that my health insurance is $200 a month, my car insurance is $100 a month, and there are a million other expenses that don&amp;#x27;t get cheaper because I live here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving to a major west or east coast city would cost me MAYBE $1500 a month in additional expenses, but I would make that all back in increased salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873906&lt;br&gt;Oh and people we’re unironically like 75% brown. Any european big city will have by default by population alone more attractive white women. USA has truly fallen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873913&lt;br&gt;I thought my hotel was in some shithole area until i found it was literally at the ”good part of the city” at upper west side. Didn’t matter, the whole place is full of homeless with decayed infrastructure if we don’t count the skyscrapers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874025&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873983&lt;br&gt;anywhere near nycha public housing (x houses like fredrick douglass houses which you were probably close to) or methadone clinics (8th ave between 32nd to 44th street) will be shitty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;every euro visits midtown when really you should be visiting the lower east side and upper brooklyn, midtown manhattan is all commercial office buildings. upper manhattan is rich jews in million dollar penthouses and museums/central park getting shittier the further you go up (the old joke was white people would all get off at 96th st)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i will give you nyc women are fucking ugly, its something in the water. i think florida unironically has better looking women by a few points. montreal has the best looking women in north america. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;marseilles was bad enough that i cannot take euros seriously when they complain about america&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874253&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;The trick is to cost of life max&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want to best ratio income:cost of life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking into account other variables such as opportunities (i guess NY have plenty), quality of life (kek), social life, proximity to family etc&lt;br&gt;And of course taxes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real cheat code being to remote from a shithole with a fat 6 fig, but I personally don&amp;#x27;t feel like fucking whores in Pattaya and have my passport in a safe. But there&amp;#x27;s layers to it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway please stay in NY don&amp;#x27;t come to my cuntry making real estate too expensive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874263&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Never been but I’ve been to Shitcago many times and it always smells like raw sewage it makes me sick. And the fucking people are everywhere. I start to feel mentally ill after a few hours there. I couldn’t imagine living there. Everyone who lives in a big city is absolutely 100% mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;chud can&amp;#x27;t handle the best city in the world &lt;br&gt;Go back to whatever white trash trailer park you came from lil bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874607&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874586&lt;br&gt;Eh european cities beat it in party scene, chicks, safety and lack of homeless. It was maybe the best city in the world in 80s but unless you really like skyscrapers, it’s just a normal third world city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874647&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;I make 36$/hr as a tradie and live in Queens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building my own business, because I live paycheck to paycheck. And I do not live lavishly at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;your constantly walking over human shit, broken bottles or dime bags&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So do the homeless just squat down and shit on the sidewalk in broad daylight? I&amp;#x27;m guessing some of it is dog shit as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve lived in Philly and didn&amp;#x27;t really see actual human feces that commonly, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874674&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872934&lt;br&gt;This is absolutely true. Since I moved here a year ago I’ve had sex with maybe 50-60 women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874766&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873983&lt;br&gt;The subhuman brownoids everywhere is disgusting though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hate grabbing the train and being the only White face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874772&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;i like nyc&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pink id&lt;br&gt;ngmi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874780&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;then move, dumbass&lt;br&gt;get a new job and head the fuck out&lt;br&gt;tell your next employer you&amp;#x27;d take a 30% pay cut (to move to an area with half the CoL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874781&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went as a german student once with my class&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;saw a black women smoke crack at her porch&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;friend fought with a mix tape scammer over one dollar at time square&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;my teacher asked a person, who just snorted a gram coke at the public transit, for directions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;haha you think that&amp;#x27;s bad, just wait til you get a load of the property taxes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874874&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874850&lt;br&gt;this in baltimore it&amp;#x27;s $10k/year in property taxes to live in a dilapidated rowhome from 1910. cities are a meme since 1960 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874884&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;i don&amp;#x27;t think i would live there even if you gave me a free house. even if it wasn&amp;#x27;t a shithole, just the taxes and bullshit would cost more than rent in most places.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874586&lt;br&gt;kys nigger homo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874916&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874874&lt;br&gt;Is this real?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874971&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872853&lt;br&gt;Yeah i was wondering about how the rich people live there. Do they just stay in their small private rich people cuck zones and take the cab everywhere? Why would anyone want to live like that? Why live in a city if you can only actually inhabit small parts of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874993&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872905&lt;br&gt;Yeah seeing kids just walking around amids the violent homeless was crazy. People in europe never have to tolerate something like that with the city of marseilles being the only exception i guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874996&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874586&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Roach likes to live in the infestation&lt;br&gt;Kys faggitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I've come to the conclusion that... — 16 replies — 8.6/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873925</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873925?lm=1771536267</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 21:24:27 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve come to the conclusion that...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873925'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 16 • Updated: 2026-02-19 21:24 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI has completely mogged Crypto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto use to be the thing people went full retarded and YOLO&amp;#x27;d their life savings into, now nobody does that anymore, but they&amp;#x27;re doing it with AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the Venture Capital funding is going into AI, there&amp;#x27;s very little VC left going into Crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not saying it&amp;#x27;s 100% over forever for us Cryptocels, but with the way things look, I wont be surprised if we have a 10+ year long crypto winter where nobody gives a single fuck about it, and Bitcoin could fall way lower than anyone within the space expects it to fall &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, in the long-term you&amp;#x27;ll see a return to Bitcoin/Crypto overall as people who made it big with AI look for a way to secure their gains in limited supply assets like Bitcoin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its just overall cooked right now and our real lives aren&amp;#x27;t gona start again for another 10 years at least&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873929&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep. &lt;br&gt;AI is a much better scam than crypto. Crypto has been made redundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873931&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873925&lt;br&gt;From one nothing burger to another. But i will admit that ai is more useful even if they&amp;#x27;re both pieces of shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873945&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873925&lt;br&gt;why not combine it?

Crypto is so easy to buy, I&amp;#x27;m not leavin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873989&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really don&amp;#x27;t understand why anyone would go into crypto when you can just yolo into precious metal miners and make more money soley off of high inflation and 24/7 of &amp;quot;unprecedented times&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who were late to crypto are now late to AI and will not recognize early what the new thing will be once it emerges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874079&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873989&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re in for a ride awakening when we see deflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874101&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874079&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;id onions cuc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874117&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873925&lt;br&gt;Fuck. I&amp;#x27;m still gonna hold but now I&amp;#x27;m never going to get married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874323&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873925&lt;br&gt;Problem is there’s no investment vehicle for ai that captures value the same way crypto does. It’s all revolving around the mag 7 and other over inflated stock valuations. Crypto tokens are still the best way to speculate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874409&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874117&lt;br&gt;I feel like if I never get married I could just retire now on my current savings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874691&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873925&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; AI has completely mogged Crypto&lt;br&gt;Crypto and AI come as a team. AI will need crypto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875779&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873925&lt;br&gt;AI is useful for the vast majority of normie needs including cheating on exams and porn, crapto can&amp;#x27;t compete with that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Would you have done the same? — 4 replies — 7.5/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875715</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875715?lm=1771541018</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:43:38 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Would you have done the same?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875715'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 4 • Updated: 2026-02-19 22:43 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a nurse at a large hospital&amp;#x27;s psych unit. I am also a newly graduated psychiatric nurse practitioner. I was about to start an NP job with a guaranteed salary of 150k with good benefits and a decent RVU bonus (bonuses for how many patients I see). However, this job has incredibly shady business practices, terrible reviews from former employees and was far away from home. The job was in a northern suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. It was three 12 hour shifts in a row without a lunch break. I was supposed to start in early April.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I resigned last night in favor of a job close to family in a rural area in the southeast USA. This job pays me a 6,000$ a month draw and 67% of my collections. After I pay off the draw in a few months I could make as much money as I want, but that is contingent on the amount of patients I see. I can work as much or as little as I want. Take as much lunch break as I want. Benefits are offered W-2, but the health insurance is expensive. Here I will be doing real psychiatry and not corporate slop crap psychiatry. Also, my family is very happy about me staying close to home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically I am trading certain money at a shit job for uncertain money (albeit a higher ceiling) at a good job. I talked to one of the NPs at the new place and he says that he makes about 24,000$ a month before taxes after working for 5 years. This would be almost double what I would have made in Frisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you think I made the right choice? Would you have done the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875728&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;so you took a better job, for higher pay, to live in a lower cost of living area with more flexibility and closer to family?&lt;br&gt;wow, just wow anon. you fucked up big&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875759&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows because every fag online claims he makes 300k a year now. No one knows what a good job is anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875728&lt;br&gt;True, but there is a worst case scenario where I am getting almost no patients and stuck in the draw for much longer than anticipated. Although if I work 5-6 days a week I doubt this will happen. Also, If I somehow get fired while still paying the draw I have to pay it all off in 10 days, which would be nightmare scenario. There is more risk with the good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875905&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875878&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no patients&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in rural shartmerica&lt;br&gt;you will be overloaded with obese diabetic fentanyl-addicted burgeoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
