What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends enormously on which country are we talking about. Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860967&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;in my country, the one thing one has to look out for is paying for your own social/healthinsurance, ie, if you have your own business, you need to pay taxes for your own health/socialinsurance, and the taxman wont ask you for the first 3y of that business.&lt;br&gt;After the 3y pass, you will then have to payup all the retrospective social insurance tax costs incurred, which fucks over a lot of retard or unfortunate first business owners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861032&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;This is why we need a unified EU business regulation and undermind the corrupt sovereignist that want to keep individual burocratic fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861057&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Some are easy (Germany)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; some are very hard (Italy)&lt;br&gt;let me guess italian never tried germany?&lt;br&gt;Germany is known to be a bureucracy hellhole with people fleeing to other countries from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;unified will fix it&lt;br&gt;France&amp;amp;germany have been dictating eu lawmaking. You will eat shit as you already do. You have eu wide higher taxes because germany didnt want to compete and made mandatory higher minimum vat a thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to mention that countries that joined got their industries destroyed by unified regulation and had to import from germany/france what they used to produce themself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the one thing the USA gets right. I personally made a &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; (that never made any profit) in the span of an afternoon. Cost maybe $200 to get my identification numbers for the llc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861091&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;yeah let&amp;#x27;s give the EU bureaucrats more power that will fix it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;br&gt;Depends on the business. If you want to do something shady the US is the place to go. The US has barely any standards and barely any regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure&lt;br&gt;What are you talking about? I live currently in the EU and have never had to wait for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861119&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Us is easier.&lt;br&gt;I have created 2 corpos and 1 llc for different purposes within the past 8 years. You can do it all online for a few bucks, other regulations depend on specific industry but overall it&amp;#x27;s pretty easy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861128&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;higher taxation alone puts euros at a disadvantage. Its fine if you do a local job since you compete with locals but anything online / shipped its bad since they have to be more efficient than rest of world to reach same profit margin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for amount of bureaucracy its fucking complex and depends on what country and what profession. There is even stupid shit like if you run a repair shop and repair inside your building it counts different than if you decide to drive to your customer and repair locally. In the later case they classify you as a handyman worker and will fine you if you didn&amp;#x27;t register with the craftsman ministry. Also if you do something you didn&amp;#x27;t register for you will also be fined but you can register as &amp;quot; i will do anything&amp;quot; more broadly and dodge it. The amount of bullshit can easily fill a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends on what your goals are, the type of business, your personal goals and the markets you wish to enter. In general it&amp;#x27;s more of an investment in the long run but if you plan to offer your services or products in the EU anyway it makes sense to start your business here and already be compliant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure.&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I remember waiting decades for my appendicitis, it rupturing and me dying because of it. Thankfully they could keep me alive for months despite the extreme difficulties this poses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;We need more unified European regulation. Sadly the EU is not an economic alliance anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;I love how hard it is to even talk about european economy on reddit, not because of europeans, but because of american lefties, if you so much, and most times you don&amp;#x27;t even need to, mention the US, they will flock like a horde to claim the US lies about everything, that 30% of americans are unemployed and nearly no one in europe, the EU is literal worker&amp;#x27;s paradise and how much they love their welfare policies and hate the US greed, its quite hilarious really how much they want a nanny state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is, soon it will was once EU Inc comes into play&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yea but you have to wait 1 year+ because there is a million niggers in queue before you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865645&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861057&lt;br&gt;Lol this is true.&lt;br&gt;Germany and France made the EU suck with their shit like GDPR etc. Spain happily sniffs every turd. The rest aren&amp;#x27;t better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your efforts are starting to go anywhere, your own government will make sure, you won&amp;#x27;t get any further.&lt;br&gt;They hate nothing more than citizens that are not dependent on them. That&amp;#x27;s why they are allowing third world people in to the maximum extent physically possible, that are never going end up being a &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; on the balance sheet, but that they hope will be cheap voting sheep for their party. The people pay for them after all, not the party.&lt;br&gt;Effectively: If Elon Musk was a citizen of a EU-country, he&amp;#x27;d already be in jail waiting for the sentence to be sent to prison. You probably don&amp;#x27;t want to get into that situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866966&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865645&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Le GDPR sucks because uhm JUST LET ME HAVE YOUR DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867520&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861071&lt;br&gt;It’s also as easy in my country (Finland)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867536&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you get to keep more money&lt;br&gt;Except they have to pay more in taxes to wait in line for months whole muslim refugees who didnt pay go before them kek. Europeans are so dumb its unreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867540&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;italy here.&lt;br&gt;50% tax is ok ?&lt;br&gt;this is shITALY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867547&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s literally impossible to build any meaningful sized company in Europe because the entire E.U. is designed to prevent anyone from competing with the aristocratic class and the privately held billion dollar company their great great grandfather built in 1870.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860842&lt;br&gt;YOU DON&amp;#x27;T KNOW WHAT YOU&amp;#x27;RE TALKING ABOUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867577&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Europe has no tech industry because German rich fags were afraid to pay coders more than traditional engineers because then car engineers would ask for more money so they just fucked all of Europe and let America and China run everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868041&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;No, in some places is actually easy, I remember playing a game in class one time in uni to look regulations for business worldwide, there&amp;#x27;s almost no difference whatsoever in european and american regulations, sometimes american regulations are actually worse and the accumulated taxes from city, state, federal can surpass european taxes. The only conclusion we could draw was that europeans were just lazy and too laidback, they have so much welfare that there&amp;#x27;s no rush or anxiety with ending up destitute and homeless so they just don&amp;#x27;t bother with the hazzle of building a business. They are better off just being on benefits or unemployed, most business there predate the big social welfare network just because of a need to survive really and complacency in changing what already works, they are much much better off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868110&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867547&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867577&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s bullshit but i believe it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868167&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867602&lt;br&gt;rip Sbarro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;this is actually hilarious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868190&lt;br&gt;Mostly sad, americans either are prosperous or starve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869496&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They are better off just being on benefits or unemployed&lt;br&gt;Can confirm, although it&amp;#x27;s currently also due to absolutely no one fucking hiring, because Germany is fucked beyond reasonable short-term hope.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s also really troublesome to do any kind of work-like activities while on benefits, because that could easily cause the termination of those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>How do I short NYC? — 14 replies — 56.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61868898</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61868898?lm=1771414057</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:27:37 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;How do I short NYC?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61868898'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 14 • Updated: 2026-02-18 11:27 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I short NYC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868918&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868898&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;middle class owning property in New York&lt;br&gt;hehe, good one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868957&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868918&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;property tax goes up 10%&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;landlord keeps the rent the same price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868970&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868898&lt;br&gt;puts on SLG, VNO, VICI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868957&lt;br&gt;why would jews do that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868898&lt;br&gt;Landlords must be so happy with this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869005&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taxes go up &amp;gt; Rents go up &amp;gt; Welfare goes up&lt;br&gt;And guess who owns all those buildings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868898&lt;br&gt;How is his base responding to this?

Same thing is going to happen with the opening of the clarity act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except when you consider that the TVL held by their oracles are 15x the current market cap of LINK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866879&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866867&lt;br&gt;I mean when that person saved it back then whoever it was, nobody knows it&amp;#x27;s all a mystery on 4chan where everybody is anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It&amp;#x27;s not me i&amp;#x27;m someone else&lt;br&gt;Kek, never change.

If the creator has been elected to the CFTC and is spearheading one of the most important clarity laws for currency adoption. What does that say for the broader market overall?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My theory is that institutions are stalling as much as possible so they can create their own private solution rather than using whats publicly available. Because that would allow for the broader market to win instead of participating in a zero sum game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867043&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866965&lt;br&gt;Being open source is one of the biggest memes where private investors can just steal what&amp;#x27;s been established and carbon copy to keep all the benefits. It&amp;#x27;s actually a tale as old as time when it comes to innovation.

OOH you don&amp;#x27;t have one. &lt;br&gt;Oh you&amp;#x27;re retarded? Poor thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864723&lt;br&gt;Then why engage? It&amp;#x27;s harder to ignore retards in real life but I still manage, but online there&amp;#x27;s no reason to even pretend. Everyone that gets ventilated by bad advice just makes your assets that much more valuable. Pretend like everyone average and below will face starvation, prostitution, conscription and death; the truth isn&amp;#x27;t far from this. You wouldn&amp;#x27;t spend all day arguing with corpses so why would you spend time on someone that doesn&amp;#x27;t know they are dead yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867144&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866917&lt;br&gt;This is really the bull case cry for stacking firearms and putting aside enough to buy sell swords. The government will do anything they think they can get away with which I why I don&amp;#x27;t think even bail ins are certain, you can do those overnight without kicking a single door but there will still be hell to pay in the morning. While stackers are a smaller population most holdings require, or rather will at such time require, going door to door to seize assets in a country in which one can put together an AR for $350-$400 and drop in FRTs can be had for as little as $100. All this against the population and asset class pairing most likely to own firearms. The logistics don&amp;#x27;t make sense. You&amp;#x27;ll see heavy taxes, threats of taxes, capital controls and possibly if briefly bans on sales after a set date. None of this yields as much gold or silver as paying an above market rate. Question is, is there anything worth trading for. If I got a deed to a substantial amount of the land the federal government loves to horde so much I could see myself parting with all (some) of my specie. Nobody can be all stick and no carrot and win. This is why in bank bail ins you atleast get shares in a bank that has recently defaulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867175&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867144&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re lucky you&amp;#x27;re but a minnow. For large investors, all of the guns in the world didn&amp;#x27;t stop Uncle Sam knocking on their door for the known vaults of metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867423&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867175&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;m not there&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They break and enter&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Thirty tons of fertilizer vaporizes a city block&lt;br&gt;Oh no no no!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867447&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;already melted down and molded into a solid gold dildo that will sell for 3x spot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867550&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866917&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;crypto&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;way easier for them to confiscate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just say you don&amp;#x27;t invest in Bitcoin, because you don&amp;#x27;t understand it, moron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is crypto 101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867583&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867550&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he thinks the government isn&amp;#x27;t in complete control of your delusional secret anonymous bits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867616&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867583&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine being this dumb and thinking that you&amp;#x27;re going to outsmart the government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t even read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867738&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867583&lt;br&gt;you don&amp;#x27;t understand how Bitcoin works at all, and your lack of understanding is not an argument&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867777&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867738&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&amp;#x27;s probably one of those people that try to argue with the police about the Constitution and Uniform Commercial Codes when they pull him over for a speeding ticket and he&amp;#x27;s made his own vehicle registration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867859&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;I wonder if the “victim” ever posted about his stack on social media?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867922&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864598&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;copy paste address to trade&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;substitution script edits the address on your clipboard for one with a similar start and end so it&amp;#x27;s visually indistinguishable unless you spend a minute verifying each address against eachother&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;gangpreet patel and his village get the capital to send another invader to your country&lt;br&gt;This isn&amp;#x27;t a joke btw, there are scripts which manipulate your clipboard like that, and it&amp;#x27;s even possible for them to be injected into innocent websites via ads.

If people ask me about investments I just say it&amp;#x27;s too complicated for me and I don&amp;#x27;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868620&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864318&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Trump writes another gold executive order like FDR&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cops at your door, &amp;quot;surrender your precious metals or you will be charged&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;what gold dunno what you&amp;#x27;re talking about&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;they arrest you&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;later they show your purchase history and post history to the court&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What now? Lawyer up against the feds? But all your wealth is buried in your backyard and all your cash is worthless from inflation (or they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be stealing your gold). You&amp;#x27;d be better off investing in bullets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868620&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; property gets auctioned off, because no one is paying the taxes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869243&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868620&lt;br&gt;By your logic 100% of people get arrested because literally all of them will say they don&amp;#x27;t have gold or silver and 95% of the ones saying that are telling the truth, but you think they&amp;#x27;ll be arrested anyway.&lt;br&gt;This is the level of cope and mental gymnastics cryptards have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869253&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oops that clipboard malware destroyed my lifesaving...

That means that what most people think of when they think &amp;quot;arts major&amp;quot; (fine arts, animation, etc.) are better-employed than criminal justice majors. They&amp;#x27;re better employed than med techs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marinate on that for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867150&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867099&lt;br&gt;Have you tried walking into google and giving Sundar a firm handshake, kiddo... That&amp;#x27;s what we used to do back in our day... Look him in the eyes and let him know you&amp;#x27;ll do whatever in takes... Extra hours, sleeping at the office... Kids these days just don&amp;#x27;t have the grit we used to have... That&amp;#x27;s why we sent men to the moon, 6 times at that, yes sir...&lt;br&gt;You gotta pay your dues, and you gotta be in it to win it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867192&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867094&lt;br&gt;A lot of people who do Criminal Justice degrees are people who watched CSI etc and want to solve murders or do forensics rather than law or general policing or whatever. The actual amount of jobs available for that field is extremely small&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;That graph is basically flatlined lol. There are things to be alarmed about, but is this really one of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867228&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do any of these stats even matter. This shit is just fud for you a couple of years now I&amp;#x27;ve been seeing so much shit like this but than nothing ever happens because of it people just move on like it doesn&amp;#x27;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867266&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867214&lt;br&gt;Tbh it shows we&amp;#x27;ve been on an unsustainable path for, at minimum, the duration of the x axis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867303&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867192&lt;br&gt;Because the laws they want to change, for the better, get rejected. We need a giga wipe of all the branches. All senators and shit, GONE. We need new blood instead of fucking 98 yr old Strom Thurman fuckers voting for shit. 2 terms, 3 years each. President only gets 2 terms, 8 years and that&amp;#x27;s it, why do THEY get to fucking stay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867341&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;This is a complete lie. Trump doubled steel production in one year. The economy has never been better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867436&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;good to know...ill start spending less to help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867442&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;I voted for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not using the criminal justice degree to do some criminal justice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867538&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867094&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;medical technicians&lt;br&gt;You go to college for &amp;#x27;useful&amp;#x27; degrees like compsci and medicine and then you&amp;#x27;re unemployed. Womp womp should have become a mechanic. Oh wait I did that too and applied to be a mechanic at the place 5 minutes up the road and they told me they already got three guys but need an inspector if I want to pay for inspection courses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know the real fucked up part? I was gonna invest 100k into BTC at 20k back in 2022. I would have been pretty much set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867546&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867228&lt;br&gt;The news just gaslights people about how millennials all somehow got 6 figure careers and some fag on /biz/ will always reply to posts like this liek &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m 36 and everyone I know is making 200k a year&amp;quot; and then will refuse to actually explain what he does or make up a fanciful story about dropshipping businesses and ebay magic, nevermind that I tried the ebay business route and that shit is too high in fees to be worth anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867341&lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t believe they did this. Are we staffed by a bunch of slimy kikes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867099&lt;br&gt;Apply for clerk at the post office. It&amp;#x27;s just as gay but 22/hr and there&amp;#x27;s no real interview&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t. Chemical engineer working for the post office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867634&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867341&lt;br&gt;fucking kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867655&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867608&lt;br&gt;Become a patent clerk instead.

How the hell did he have so much energy? I feel drained after sending an email or answering a simple &amp;quot;how is it going?&amp;quot; from a friend.
