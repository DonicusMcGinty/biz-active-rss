I have a few bullshit Internet businesses that AI models automate 90+% of off one of these.

The problem with the cheap option here being - again - you can cool GPUs and they are somewhat designed to be ran at high temps for extended periods. Mac Minis weren&amp;#x27;t and aren&amp;#x27;t. And these retards are going to fry their Mactrash, abusing them 24/7 as retarded AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;you really don&amp;#x27;t need a mac mini, old Lenovo Thinkcenters work perfectly fine and you get get a used one with 32GB of ram and 2 TB of disk space for like $200-300&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been using a few with Unbuntu installed to run a bunch of agents on an isolated Vlan at home. (These things are honestly security risks, don&amp;#x27;t give them access to your home network or personal info)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895820&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895757&lt;br&gt;chatgpt is useless now, its a glorified yes man. You can actually trick it into giving horrific advice. Which puts it at the level of a 32 year old life coach, nothing more. Gemini is a good tool if you can get a local unit to run, great for helping map and document trades. But nothing more than that, if you really needed something to bounce ideas off of it isn&amp;#x27;t that. But that is all you can expect out of it, a really good calculator. It&amp;#x27;s when people expect it to be a thinking breathing human is when problems arise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895868&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895788&lt;br&gt;And what model can you on 32gb ram? Thinkcentres dont have dedicated gpu do they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895868&lt;br&gt;no one is running the actual model locally, this is for running the agent and all its tools, most people are running API calls off Openrouter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>European funds for an american — 31 replies — 124.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61890472</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61890472?lm=1771944133</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:42:13 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;European funds for an american&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61890472'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 31 • Updated: 2026-02-24 14:42 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to put 20% of my account in foreign, but not all foreign is created equal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I predicted the rise in the polish economy. It&amp;#x27;s very simple, a homogenous white country free from communism is always going to become rich. A diverse country full of communists like Canada and South Africa is going to get worse and worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also predicted that the real-estate market in Croatia would sky rocket due to whites fleeing countries like the UK. I was right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So.... are there any good mutual/index funds that target the white regions of Europe, that an American can invest in? Is there a Balkans fund? A Baltic fund? Norway/Finland fund (not Sweden or Denmark)? I do not want to invest in the UK, France, Germany, or Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890485&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;finland&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;white&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890499&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;please buy my bag&lt;br&gt;nein. Death to every communist, that includes every single member of a political party, everyone over 50, every bureaucrat and every single subsidized &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; which in europe is every company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890518&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No fucking way those numbers on finland are right. I live in Helsinki and it’s like 25% brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890524&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;You are correct about Poland but everybody knew and knows about Poland but nobody wants to talk about why they&amp;#x27;ve been the hottest economy in Europe for 15 years (white and Christian).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway. You&amp;#x27;ve never heard of EPOL?&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve owned the Polish index tracker ETFs for 8 years and it has done nicely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otherwise, Baltics do have stock markets but they are Frontier markets (this is below emerging markets) and you basically can&amp;#x27;t buy them if you&amp;#x27;re not in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norway invests in U.S. stocks. So does Sweden and their banks. Hottest Swedish bank stock is 100% invested in NYSE traded companies. So it&amp;#x27;s circular. If you invest in European banks or Norway you&amp;#x27;re actually buying U.S. stocks with extra steps. EPOL is heavily weighted towards Polish banks and you guessed it - they all hold U.S. company stocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;European Bank customers are just a source of capital to invest in the New York Stock Exchange. And I&amp;#x27;m an insider so I know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want an actual good EU based investment buy WDEF. European defense spending will be hot for 15 years. Otherwise buy Spotify and the upcoming revolut IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890524&lt;br&gt;Any funds for manufacturing from the regions I mentioned in the OP, or medical services?&lt;br&gt;Medical services will always be the last to go even under socialism since Europeans will bankrupt their country with debt before they let a hospital go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890855&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890543&lt;br&gt;You clearly don&amp;#x27;t understand the region. You&amp;#x27;re way out of your depth and element. I&amp;#x27;m sorry but it would take me hours to explain this to you.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t. American in Latvia who knows Poland pretty well (dated a Polish chick and been there many times).&lt;br&gt;You assume Eastern Europe has the economic model of America or Germany, just poorer and white. You&amp;#x27;re way off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890868&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;France &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;85%&lt;br&gt;lmaoooo&lt;br&gt;this is the 1972 census?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890982&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890524&lt;br&gt;This map is from 10 or 15 years ago, it&amp;#x27;s actually changing rapidly now. Im from a small town and back then i haven&amp;#x27;t ever saw any foreign looking face apart from an occasional gypsy. Now we have filipino, indian, and central asian &amp;quot;guest&amp;quot; workers coming here to the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890989&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890868&lt;br&gt;France is pretty much 100% white outside of Paris and the south&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890989&lt;br&gt;not at all. Even the smallest, most remote villages are chokefull of shitskins. There isn&amp;#x27;t a single STREET in the countryside not populated with at least 2-3 shitskins/niggers.&lt;br&gt;I know becuz i live in one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;a homogenous white country free from communism&lt;br&gt;not Sweden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891154&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890855&lt;br&gt;I have friends who moved to Croatia. Reason? White flight from the UK. Highly productive middle class white people pouring out of one area and into another, means good things for one economy and bad things for the other. It&amp;#x27;s no different than watching the small cities that surround Akron, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, Baltimore, etc... All get richer and richer and have better and better economies due to all of the whites in those cities pouring out into the surrounding areas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say it&amp;#x27;s not that simple, yet I&amp;#x27;ve told people this will happen and for 30 years, I&amp;#x27;ve been right. I watched the real estate market in Croatia skyrocket into the stratosphere. I&amp;#x27;ve also made a lot of money on real-estate outside of Cleveland and Akron just by investing in the white flight destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890868&lt;br&gt;This is in fact, old data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891134&lt;br&gt;Yes. That&amp;#x27;s why I said funds that invest in Norway and Finland, but not Denmark and Sweden. I know Finland isn&amp;#x27;t really Nordic but they&amp;#x27;re next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891236&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891154&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s fine but from the average person&amp;#x27;s perspective you can&amp;#x27;t understand the bigger economic picture and appreciate the vast differences in market size and capital flows.&lt;br&gt;Life for average people may be more or less similar in Croatia and England but the English stock exchange is in another universe compared to these small economies.&lt;br&gt;As I said, I&amp;#x27;m an American living in Latvia. My life is better in Latvia. I&amp;#x27;m just a normal guy. The top 1% and .01% would see things quite differently. Where does one park $100,000,000 in the Baltics?&lt;br&gt;Answer: you don&amp;#x27;t. And downstream from that is YOU don&amp;#x27;t get to invest $50,000 in an Estonia market ETF either. These are frontier markets not even as developed as Brazil or India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891243&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891003&lt;br&gt;Euskadi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891236&lt;br&gt;I think real-estate, and downstream from that medical services, are pretty simple by and large because they&amp;#x27;re mostly just a matter of predicting the migration patterns of middle class white people, while avoiding the political behavior of lumpenprole voters. At a bare minimum investing in medical services and realestate are a safe bet in any communist free white flight destination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question then becomes, what financial products are available to me that resemble that in any way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s a fund called NHCBHFFT that invests in real estate in estonia, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891396&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I do not want to invest in the UK&lt;br&gt;FTSE100 has been outperforming the S&amp;amp;P500 for a while now but okay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891622&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891396&lt;br&gt;I want a stock that will perform well long term, the UK, like Canada and South Africa, has not future unless it claws it&amp;#x27;s way back from Weimar conditions. The massive white flight that has already taken place and has been accelerating, looks exactly how things looked for Detroit, Chicago, Oakland, Baltimore, etc... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghettofication is an economy killer. Because people ignore it and it makes people irrational, that is the area an investor can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892062&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;Brown migration is stagnating across Europe and so is the birthrate of migrants of the 2nd/3rd generation. The number of migrants are not big enough to not be outbred in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;This is probably based on early 90s data when Bulgaria was full of gypsies, France was full of North Africans, but the rest of the countries were fine.&lt;br&gt;Now Bulgarian gypsies are also abroad and the roles are reversed, lol (except for France, that&amp;#x27;s only getting worse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892365&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892062&lt;br&gt;sounds like copium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892695&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892062&lt;br&gt;White flight is the real economy killer. Again, look at all the places already mentioned. Niggers in america don&amp;#x27;t have exceptional birthrates but once they&amp;#x27;re 20% of a city everyone else runs away. Same as true for states and countries. Most nigger cities in America have half the population they had the in 60s. Akron and Cleveland have lost about half of their population due to white flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892982&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890855&lt;br&gt;This. &lt;br&gt;I’m polish and I can explain a bit just to give a gist. &lt;br&gt;Poland’s “capitalist” period started in ‘89 so to this day the biggest companies included in WIG20 are completely controlled by National Treasury. So 8 of them constitute about 55% of the index. &lt;br&gt;So mind you by loading up on indexes you’re not really buying innovation rather iron clad businesses that aren’t really growth oriented. &lt;br&gt;Let’ take an example of searching for growth sectors like everyone talks about polish developers so it would be safe to assume that IT stuff has growth potential. &lt;br&gt;And here the biggest IT company is CD project which makes fucking games a dying industry that will be killed by small teams with ai making indie games. &lt;br&gt;Rest of well known IT firms are privately owned or controlled by ventures. &lt;br&gt;It’s hard to really find good stuff I personally think you should search for companies making tangible products or services example solar panels, beauty sector, pharma. &lt;br&gt;We’ve got a lot of ecomerce, construction, pharma/cosmetics, news outlets. Not really innovative stuff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean I wish it was different but really if someone made something meaningful here he would be molested to death by venture capital like CVC Capital Partners and eventually cave in take cash run and live a beautiful trad life in Bielsko Biała.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892982&lt;br&gt;Cont.&lt;br&gt;So to comparing to the US, Poland is a polar opposite. &lt;br&gt;In the US Capital lobbies politics. In Poland the only people who can lobby are foreign players and people with political power. And this political power has more influence on the stock market while in the US stock market and capital makes politics. &lt;br&gt;The end communist era ripples through Poland up to this day. The people responsible for the transition made themselves very powerful and control the capital to this day. The good news it that their descendants are retarded beyond comprehension and will be unable to maintain power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892695&lt;br&gt;They will just flee from one city to another, Germans aren&amp;#x27;t moving from Germany to go to fucking Poopland lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895226&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Balkans&lt;br&gt;ha haha hahahahahahaha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895249&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893067&lt;br&gt;That doesn&amp;#x27;t sound like good news&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895250&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;South Korea, Japan and Brazil.&lt;br&gt;Lmao if you want to put it into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895308&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;Check how cucked European stocks are with regards to taxes.&lt;br&gt;The only European stocks i would invest in are stocks listed in London Stock Exchange for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895226&lt;br&gt;The Balkans are probably majority white now, because all of the gyppos are here in Finland and other Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895890&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890472&lt;br&gt;Look into EU military companies. Saab, Rheinmetall etc. have had huge growth and are still on the rise.&lt;br&gt;Also whatever alternative renewables there are. (Things like synthetic fuels and deep geothermal)&lt;br&gt;Also companies that are processing rare earths and minerals. It is expected that the Europeans will start to extract those resources soon. The usual structure is that companies from outside the EU can mine, but are contractually obligated to sell most of the resources to companies inside of the Union for processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also tech is fine. Plenty of EU countries are turning their backs towards US tech. Many government offices are currently swapping to different software, mostly open source. Expect EU companies to code scaleable European solutions soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>How far will BTC crash when MSTR closes its doors and liquidates its holdings? — 4 replies — 16.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61895670</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61895670?lm=1771944124</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:42:04 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;How far will BTC crash when MSTR closes its doors and liquidates its holdings?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61895670'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 4 • Updated: 2026-02-24 14:42 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far will BTC crash when MSTR closes its doors and liquidates its holdings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895790&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;there is nothing compelling them to &amp;#x27;liquidate&amp;#x27; their holdings&lt;br&gt;this is just a fantasy of yours and not a real eventuality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895835&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895790&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;there is nothing compelling them to &amp;#x27;liquidate&amp;#x27; their holdings&lt;br&gt;MSTR shareholders may beg to differ.&lt;br&gt;There is equally nothing compelling them to ride Saylors elevator all the way to zero.

Women crave a man higher on the totem pole than they are, now they can&amp;#x27;t find one for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892313&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;I make faceless straight gay porn.

I knew a waitress 2 years ago working in a shitty diner that was finessing 3-4 boomers, I remember one time a boomer literally handed her a $3,000 check, no sexual favors or anything, just sweet talk, this chick was spending 5-10,000 dollars a month on clothes and was driving a brand new Jeep luxury model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893458&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;I know a money laundering scheme when I see one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893483&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892313&lt;br&gt;Fucking kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893517&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;At least i can coom out of the leaked photos of these e-prostitutes, i can&amp;#x27;t cope with the fact some teenage faggot like barron trump (or Eric i don&amp;#x27;t know who&amp;#x27;s is who in that family of pagan gods worshiper faggots) make billions just because he was born in the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893555&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have never paid for porn or whores in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893557&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;the same way I cope with dude getting paid millions to play with balls, I don&amp;#x27;t care. it&amp;#x27;s not me and it doesn&amp;#x27;t impact me, so why should I give a shit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;99% of them are making like 20 bucks a month lmfao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889354&lt;br&gt;I met a girl who was a friend of a friend of mine at a party when I was younger and she literally handed me a business card with her OF address on it. I didn&amp;#x27;t realize what it was at first but the second I read it I blurted out &amp;quot;What the fuck is wrong with you?&amp;quot; without thinking and she got super offended. I&amp;#x27;m pretty sure I was the first person she handed it to that actually said anything negative about it by the way she reacted, which is very bizarre to me. It&amp;#x27;s kind of crazy how common this shit is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893680&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Like everything in the world of money being born a woman was a gamble&lt;br&gt;You just lost it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think about women at all anon. They are the worst investment you can make in life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893708&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889282&lt;br&gt;this right here. tons of people play sports, statistically, 0.000001 get paid well. Image stretching you butthole for a year or two and then finally coming to the conclusion it would have been both easier and more profitable to work a mcjob. add in its a clear red flag so they wont ever get a quality man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893748&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893140&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t. tranny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894411&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;cope, if i can show my penis for millions i would flex on them hoes bro while being paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61894435&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s all fake.

I am not asking you to hold those warrants until they are exercised. I am asking you to hold them and sell the warrants when we can realize a substantial profit. Nice quads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880091&lt;br&gt;Interesting. Wouldn&amp;#x27;t trading the warrants implicitly come with a short term capital gains tax insofar as its impossible to hold them over a year at this point? Would have to be some pretty fair gains to offset that 40% hit...anyways doesn&amp;#x27;t the warrants increasing in price also imply that the shares have gone up in price as well? I ran some informal modeling estimates using black scholes with iv, roughly .65 years to expiry and this is what I came up with: 15.5 bbby share price = 4.50ish warrant price...25 share price/12ish warrant price...60 share price/45ish warrant price...100 share price/85ish warrant price...200 share price 185ish warrant price...I make no claim as to the veracity of these numbers, just for fun. Anyways what do you see happening to the bbby stock price for these warrants to be worthwhile? Am I thinking on the right track in general?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881670&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881753&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879999&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881477&lt;br&gt;note the digis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881916&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;Buy these if you want, but remember, these warrants are not related to the canceled BBBYQ/DK-Butterfly, reguardless of what the BBBYQ schizos say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881980&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881916&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nobody tell him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882152&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;I hold a few&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882389&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;why are americans starting to invest more into VT?&lt;br&gt;isn&amp;#x27;t america the greatest country on earth?&lt;br&gt;for me it has always been VOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;look at NPC holder distribution&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;there&amp;#x27;s no big dumps&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;base still present&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;conviction quietly intact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884950&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880091&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re allowed to buy warrants, won&amp;#x27;t your employer know you bought them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885366&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get ready everyone.

Thinking about my taxes was an achilles heel for me because I would keep seeing my port at an ATH, then do the mental math on the taxes I&amp;#x27;d owe if I realized it all, then be mad that my real net worth after taxes was really 30% lower than it was on paper, and then I&amp;#x27;d resolve to make another 1.3x so I could &amp;#x27;make back&amp;#x27; the money I just felt I&amp;#x27;d lost doing the mental math.

Alt coin game is too time consuming for the diminishing gains. At least selling tops and buying bottoms of Bitcoin only is comparatively easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895206&lt;br&gt;The type to run it up to 12M in the first place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895320&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895206&lt;br&gt;some retarded NEET who drank the koolaid that his shitcoin was going to change the world (it didn&amp;#x27;t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895358&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894267&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;class&lt;br&gt;2010&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;initial &lt;br&gt;$0&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ath&lt;br&gt;Theoretical amount, 860k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;current&lt;br&gt;$1200&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spend day after day trying to get whatever I can via stock trading.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m $1800 in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895367&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;im just glad i made it out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895449&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61894267&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; class of &lt;br&gt;2013&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; initial&lt;br&gt;5k &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; ATH&lt;br&gt;500k&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; current &lt;br&gt;100k&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;biggest disappointment&lt;br&gt;everything. Sold all my 100 BTC in 2014, went close to 300k on a shitcoin in 2018 than then immediately collapsed, got liquidated in 2022, went to 500k on another coin in 2025 but was locked in a stake for a year and when it was released, it was only worth 5k. I have fucked up again and again and gave up, i am not made for crypto or being wealthy. Could have had 10M+ if I just had kept holding btc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895501&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s another question, how are your fellow alumni doing? Living on a beach in Bali? Rekt waging and suicidal? Obviously there&amp;#x27;s survival bias here but I haven&amp;#x27;t kept up with anyone from my class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for OP&amp;#x27;s question.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;class of&lt;br&gt;2017&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;initial&lt;br&gt;20k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ath&lt;br&gt;1.8m&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;current&lt;br&gt;1.1m&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;biggest fumble&lt;br&gt;sold TRX at the literal unironic sat bottom kek, when it went parabolic I wanted to kms and it still stings a little but don&amp;#x27;t think about it much these days&lt;br&gt;also blew up half of my port on perps&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;biggest disappointment&lt;br&gt;The time cost mostly. Waiting a decade for a &amp;quot;measly&amp;quot; 1m which logically speaking isn&amp;#x27;t that bad but I wasted my youth and formative years looking at charts and having nothing to show for it. Any regular wagie has or will surpass me soon on top of having a more fulfilling social life network and career. I was always destined to be a sperg loser so I guess I can&amp;#x27;t be too mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895534&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;what causes the next bull run? What is crypto&amp;#x27;s future? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are past insitutional adoption, past regulation, past retail adoption (retail was burned hard by scamcoins), what causes the next run up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m thinking we need to wait until retail forgets its past pain and we get another big stimulus check or something and they gamble it away on crypto. The only problem with this theory is that gambling has basically become legal now with gambling apps and the money might all flow into that instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895549&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895130&lt;br&gt;No idea. I don&amp;#x27;t own shitcoins anymore outside of dust for the memes so don&amp;#x27;t care what happens to them, but at the bottom of every cycle the doomer narratives become the strongest, it always feels like it&amp;#x27;s genuinely over this time and we endure months/years of no price action, we&amp;#x27;re probably looking for even more pain once the multi-year recession for stocks comes. Recessions in stocks traditionally last 3.3 years (ath to ath, 11 months to bottom). But it&amp;#x27;s exactly that sinking feeling of despair in the pit of your stomach when even seasoned traders have lost all hope that wrecks normies and allows others to make money, why market cycles never stop occurring. But that&amp;#x27;s a tradfi thing so who knows maybe I&amp;#x27;ll baghold and kms in a decade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing that bothers me the most is I am becoming old now (in my 30s) and weathering another market cycle means the prime of my life will already be pretty much over and I&amp;#x27;d have to give up on finding a wife, having kids. I never made enough money to make up for the other shortcomings in my life, and the chickens are finally coming home to roost, as they say. On the bright side I can always wage with financial security which is nice, but the dreams I had when I was young have mostly vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61895610&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61895549&lt;br&gt;Why dont you just freeze your sperm if you’re worried about that? Being wealthy in your 40s you should have no problem finding a wife in her mid/late 20s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Link vs XRP — 47 replies — 19.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889600</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889600?lm=1771935560</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 12:19:20 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Link vs XRP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889600'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 47 • Updated: 2026-02-24 12:19 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will the gap close? Link came within a hair of flipping xrp in January ‘21. We all know that Link is everything Xrp fraudulently claims to be so it makes sense that this chart should flip soon enough. Will it be gradual or violent? Will it flip because xrp crashes or because Link moons? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly where are some places you can use Link as collateral to borrow Xrp to take full advantage of the trade of the century?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889606&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m so tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889622&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;Link is scam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy XRP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890870&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889622&lt;br&gt;the only usecase any of these has is XLM; because africans are still trading phone minutes as currency and XLM is a reasonable replacement&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XRP and LINK are complete LARPs that nobody even trusts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and i don&amp;#x27;t even give a shit about giving africans currency. but its literally the only thing your larp does in the physical world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890891&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890390&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;common enterprise&lt;br&gt;You bought a product, not a share. Everything you just wrote proves this is a speculation and not an investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889827&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;https://ripple.com/insights/institutional-defi-on-xrpl-scaling-real-world-finance-with-xrp-at-the-core/&lt;br&gt;You keep posting same article like its some kind of mic drop moment. As if linking it over and over suddenly turns it into undeniable proof. It doesn’t lol Youre taking a CEOs words at face value because you think hes personally invested in making you rich. Thats not how this works. CEOs promote their companies and his job is to literally sell you XRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891035&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;Thanks spammy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891011&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not. It is literally the products they are building and the material they are releasing detailing it to shareholders. Link sell directly to retail every time there is a minor pump. You are literally saying nothing but standing in a way where you think if you come across as affirmative in a direct way it will seem like you are. Lol You are just doing what you accuse me of (which I am not) saying we can&amp;#x27;t trust it to be true because it is relying on the words of someone. It literally isn&amp;#x27;t. They are structuring XRPL core amendment pushes and having their staff code them based on the product suite fit detailed in the article. They made multiple multibillion dollar acquisitions, including a fucking prime broker to actuate it all. And most importantly, the majority of their treasury is in XRP and their products are ALL made more efficient and cost efficient using it and they are incentivized to increase the price of XRP they have in escrow and cannot sell, unlike CLL who dump what was supposed to be operator rewards on retail always and are LITERALLY a fraud designed to milk your savings (exactly what you project Ripple to be, which it isn&amp;#x27;t because the XRPL actually solves efficiencies instead of sticking a tollbooth in the middle of process for literally no reason like a jewish parasite). The entire XRPL is designed to automatically use XRP for auto-bridging between assets etc. Your argument sucks and it is hilarious that it actually applies to link, which you are capable of seeing but literally don&amp;#x27;t care because you are in a literal cult pretending to object but just obsessively committed to a project that is the least morally redeemable or utility having one in all of crypto for literally no reason than ego and entrenched specific coin cultism. Really odd and gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890083&lt;br&gt;Extreme cope. SWIFT said it would take 15 years MINIMUM to even get a product active. I am not sorry to let you know that by that time SWIFT will have 100% missed the boat and payments will have been completely revolutionized, not needing them. You hitched your dingy to a big ship, but it turned out it was the Titanic, which we all always said. Way too little way too late presuming the ethgate lawfare would win but it didn&amp;#x27;t. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890250&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;MPT/permissioned dex is the standard&lt;br&gt;No it hasn&amp;#x27;t. You literally don&amp;#x27;t know what either of those things are. No other ledger at scale has a built in dex and amm and protocol layer compliance like permissioned dex nor the broadness of the MPT standard. It definitely has been The Standard, but not in the way you think. MPT is not &amp;quot;wrapped assets.&amp;quot; Here is an AI slop video that is actually informative which possibly someone at your level of research will be able to be spoonfed by:&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/3kYXW_o-N4Y&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890519&lt;br&gt;Top cope in thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890891&lt;br&gt;Everything written proves it&amp;#x27;s a security anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890307&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890390&lt;br&gt;The only thing that needs to happen to settle the debate is someone suing. And given chainlink seemingly gives zero fucks about it&amp;#x27;s holders it&amp;#x27;s probably long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891887&lt;br&gt;It has an etf already bro it’s a defacto commodity and will soon be enshrined in law as a commodity. Also may I just congratulate you on your point that ripple is incentivised to increase the price of Xrp since that is most of their treasury, unlike CLL who also has most of their treasury in Link but is not incentivised to increase the price. I thought that was most salient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892122&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;Dunno man, but the best times with link have been when I forgot about it during the bear and came back to big gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892185&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891717&lt;br&gt;So other than the CEOs word, what proof do you have they&amp;#x27;re integrating XRP into everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892337&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892108&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CLL who also has most of their treasury in Link but is not incentivised to increase the price.&lt;br&gt;And they never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892414&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891011&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youre taking a CEOs words at face value because you think hes personally invested in making you rich. Thats not how this works. CEOs promote their companies and his job is to literally sell you link&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892515&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892337&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When will the gap close?&lt;br&gt;when the token will be needed for functioning of the network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892592&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891914&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The only thing that needs to happen to settle the debate is someone suing. And given chainlink seemingly gives zero fucks about it&amp;#x27;s holders it&amp;#x27;s probably long overdue.&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892185&lt;br&gt;I already mentioned it you fucking retard. You can see the ledger amendment history that they have spent their own dev money and time developing, their acquisitions of Hidden Road, etc. their getting binance listing RLUSD on the XRPL, the fact the early team specifically coded the ledger to explicitly default to its use and to save several percentage points over Ripplenet alone by doing so, the fact that they locked the vast bulk of their corporate treasury up in timed release in it, the fact they fund and partner with multiple large banks to drive and encourage its use and adoption, and the fact the services they are building out literally optimize using it and offer counterparty-less feature that no other asset onchain can, and the fact that they already use it in their business. They literally legally can&amp;#x27;t use it in most contexts yet but with clarity their business can become much more efficient and as a result their core holding increases in value. There is LITERALLY no reason to argue they are not building for its use other than being butthurt that it is true and trying to repress reality like a faggot. They literally have Fednow service providers running XRPL nodes and big banks who are their largest outside investors issuing bonds that reward in XRP (who were celebrated recently in their specific crypto efforts by the financial regulator of Japan) and are partnering with DBS (biggest bank in Singapore (Switzerland of Asia) and Franklin Templeton (trillion plus dollars AUM) building out a repo market on the XRPL. They got ONDO issuing on the XRPL, one of the largest asset managers in Europe/England doing same while basically no one is getting headway in England, Societe General (one of biggest banks in Europe) expanding to include XRP for their euro stablecoin which can bridge to RLUSD using XRP, etc. Literally everything they do builds around corporately driving XRP&amp;#x27;s adoption, literally just fleshing out a business sweet around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892679&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892659&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892185&lt;br&gt;This isn&amp;#x27;t even 10% of what could be said partnership etc. wise. XRP and link are different in that XRP actually improves business performance and has a reason to exist and incentivizes use in products. Link is literally just a toll booth jew token to insert costs where they would not technologically exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892108&lt;br&gt;The difference is CLL dumps on retail all the time and their business is not improved by the operation of link, it is a technologically pointless token, literally. Ripple hasn&amp;#x27;t sold publicly in over 5 years to retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892697&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;It will most likely be extremely violent the likes of which has literally never been seen before. I am very excited for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892933&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891755&lt;br&gt;you&amp;#x27;re practically crying, and they did not say that. I&amp;#x27;m sorry you bet on the wrong horse backed by criminals. to think swift is going to lose is unbelievable amounts of stupidity. haha why am i even talking to you, cya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892973&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893028&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;br&gt;I mean you&amp;#x27;re retarded and wrong but the cripplets are retarded and right. If that helps at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Idk if you link cucks have ever visited the /XSG/ threads but they are hardly ever discussing &amp;quot;muh utility&amp;quot; or even acknowledging other crypto. I&amp;#x27;m pretty sure they&amp;#x27;re currently going /X/ mode and trying to get a retard to be a sacrifice volunteer Mayan style to pump xrp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is hilarious.

When clarity passes, Link will moon the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892602&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892595&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When clarity passes, Link will moon the hardest.&lt;br&gt;Who writes these jokes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892611&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892582&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a Muslim man but I have to admit that pregnant Sergey really turns me on. I keep fantasizing about putting my seed inside him and watching new life grow... We get married, he gives birth, and we raise that baby under the blessings of Allah. I want to hold hands with Sergey, and looking into his eyes say &amp;#x27;I love you.&amp;#x27; I think of myself taking our son to his first day at school, watching that strong and masculine boy develop amazing computer skills like his dad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sergey would be the ideal partner for any man wishing to start a family. His great genes give him a combination of assertiveness, strength, and intelligence. If Sergey is able to get pregnant, he has to have a uterus; if he has a uterus, he can only be a woman in the eyes of Allah. ALLAHU AKHBAR!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, I can&amp;#x27;t hide this anymore. It&amp;#x27;s coming from deep inside of me... this desire to shout...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;M A GAY MUSLIM AND I HOLD CHAINLINK! Yes, and I am not the only one. I was attracted to this community because of the feeling of brotherhood that it creates. Together we are one. We are above gender divisions and categories. Chainlink, as you know, is a gay sex position where men stick their dicks into each other&amp;#x27;s asses to form a link.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, I declare Chainlink to be the currency of the LGBT community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;M GAY AND I HOLD CHAINLINK.
