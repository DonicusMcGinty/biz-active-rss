What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends enormously on which country are we talking about. Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure.&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I remember waiting decades for my appendicitis, it rupturing and me dying because of it. Thankfully they could keep me alive for months despite the extreme difficulties this poses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;We need more unified European regulation. Sadly the EU is not an economic alliance anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;I love how hard it is to even talk about european economy on reddit, not because of europeans, but because of american lefties, if you so much, and most times you don&amp;#x27;t even need to, mention the US, they will flock like a horde to claim the US lies about everything, that 30% of americans are unemployed and nearly no one in europe, the EU is literal worker&amp;#x27;s paradise and how much they love their welfare policies and hate the US greed, its quite hilarious really how much they want a nanny state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is, soon it will was once EU Inc comes into play&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yea but you have to wait 1 year+ because there is a million niggers in queue before you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865645&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861057&lt;br&gt;Lol this is true.&lt;br&gt;Germany and France made the EU suck with their shit like GDPR etc. Spain happily sniffs every turd. The rest aren&amp;#x27;t better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your efforts are starting to go anywhere, your own government will make sure, you won&amp;#x27;t get any further.&lt;br&gt;They hate nothing more than citizens that are not dependent on them. That&amp;#x27;s why they are allowing third world people in to the maximum extent physically possible, that are never going end up being a &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; on the balance sheet, but that they hope will be cheap voting sheep for their party. The people pay for them after all, not the party.&lt;br&gt;Effectively: If Elon Musk was a citizen of a EU-country, he&amp;#x27;d already be in jail waiting for the sentence to be sent to prison. You probably don&amp;#x27;t want to get into that situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866966&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865645&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Le GDPR sucks because uhm JUST LET ME HAVE YOUR DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867520&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861071&lt;br&gt;It’s also as easy in my country (Finland)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867536&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you get to keep more money&lt;br&gt;Except they have to pay more in taxes to wait in line for months whole muslim refugees who didnt pay go before them kek. Europeans are so dumb its unreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867540&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;italy here.&lt;br&gt;50% tax is ok ?&lt;br&gt;this is shITALY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867547&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s literally impossible to build any meaningful sized company in Europe because the entire E.U. is designed to prevent anyone from competing with the aristocratic class and the privately held billion dollar company their great great grandfather built in 1870.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860842&lt;br&gt;YOU DON&amp;#x27;T KNOW WHAT YOU&amp;#x27;RE TALKING ABOUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867577&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Europe has no tech industry because German rich fags were afraid to pay coders more than traditional engineers because then car engineers would ask for more money so they just fucked all of Europe and let America and China run everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868041&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;No, in some places is actually easy, I remember playing a game in class one time in uni to look regulations for business worldwide, there&amp;#x27;s almost no difference whatsoever in european and american regulations, sometimes american regulations are actually worse and the accumulated taxes from city, state, federal can surpass european taxes. The only conclusion we could draw was that europeans were just lazy and too laidback, they have so much welfare that there&amp;#x27;s no rush or anxiety with ending up destitute and homeless so they just don&amp;#x27;t bother with the hazzle of building a business. They are better off just being on benefits or unemployed, most business there predate the big social welfare network just because of a need to survive really and complacency in changing what already works, they are much much better off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868110&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867547&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867577&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s bullshit but i believe it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868167&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867602&lt;br&gt;rip Sbarro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;this is actually hilarious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868190&lt;br&gt;Mostly sad, americans either are prosperous or starve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869496&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They are better off just being on benefits or unemployed&lt;br&gt;Can confirm, although it&amp;#x27;s currently also due to absolutely no one fucking hiring, because Germany is fucked beyond reasonable short-term hope.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s also really troublesome to do any kind of work-like activities while on benefits, because that could easily cause the termination of those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869942&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;Can confirm. I enjoy 9,5 weeks of yearly paid leave. Salary is decent, I won&amp;#x27;t be a billionaire but I don&amp;#x27;t care, I have more free time that I know what to do with. Planning my next Japan trip on my current free time btw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869994&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866966&lt;br&gt;gdpr is extra annoyances for everyone + it doesn&amp;#x27;t even protect my data, you faggot, SO WHAT WAS THE FUCKING POINT OF IT ALL EXCEPT TO HUMILIATE THE FUCKING CITIZEN????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870065&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Germany is easy&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a joke right? Germany is literally the country that shaped modern bureaucracy into the hellpit it is today. Post WW II Germans made it a mission to have everything under control, documented and organized so they can ensure something like this doesn&amp;#x27;t happen again. It&amp;#x27;s deeply engrained in every aspect of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870103&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865645&lt;br&gt;mug GDPR. Just go for legitimate use and document what your pseudonymyze and no one cares anymore lmao. add a random mail address for right to forget, and done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally launched a company (real, doing &amp;gt; 500k€ arr) in France, enjoyed JEI status and CIR/CII credits, and we even have the bpifrance hack that gives you no string attached loans to boost any equity fundraise you make (can give you 500k-1M€ in addition to a raise),&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;what it means? basically Macron created loopholes to reduces taxes and increase funding indirectly, with these shit, because boomers are blocking any real reforms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Macron tried it seems, and also the pool of talent is better here for high level stuff, which seem to be the next decades. No one needs medium fullstack coders or general engineers, we need experts and this is what this country produces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870110&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870065&lt;br&gt;They liked to thoroughly document shit during and before WW2 as well. It wasn&amp;#x27;t some post war re-awakening&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869994&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;gdpr is extra annoyances for everyone&lt;br&gt;Just don&amp;#x27;t collect data for commercial purposes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;it doesn&amp;#x27;t even protect my data&lt;br&gt;It does but not allowing certain monetization strategies of the data, informing you about how, which and why what points of data are used and giving the EU a mechanism to fight against, mostly foreign, companies violating your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870164&lt;br&gt;did you read anything of what i said there and ignored it or are you just retarded?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Just don&amp;#x27;t collect data for commercial purposes&lt;br&gt;as a user, having to click on shit on every website for gdpr is annoying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It does but not allowing certain monetization strategies of the data, informing you about how, which and why what points of data are used and giving the EU a mechanism to fight against, mostly foreign, companies violating your privacy.&lt;br&gt;yeah you definitely are retarded. which part of &amp;quot;it does not protect my data&amp;quot; did you not understand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870199&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;starting a business is very easy on both sides of the atlantic. scaling is harder in the EU because it&amp;#x27;s a fragmented market with wildly different rulesets between member states and capital markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870203&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870191&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;as a user, having to click on shit on every website for gdpr is annoying&lt;br&gt;Oh the horror! Let me guess, in most cases you just have to click &amp;#x27;disable all&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;save&amp;#x27; right? Here&amp;#x27;s a pro-tip to save you the time: Block the domain or script they use for their cookie banners&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;which part of &amp;quot;it does not protect my data&amp;quot; did you not understand?&lt;br&gt;The part where you lied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870682&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870203&lt;br&gt;ah, i see, you are retarded. just because some laws that are lax exist doesn&amp;#x27;t mean data is protected, you fucking retarded faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Are there ANY good job boards left besides fucking LinkedIn by Microslop?? — 29 replies — 116.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61864195</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61864195?lm=1771435750</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:29:10 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Are there ANY good job boards left besides fucking LinkedIn by Microslop??&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61864195'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 29 • Updated: 2026-02-18 17:29 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there ANY good job boards left besides fucking LinkedIn by Microslop??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864202&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn is complete dogshit so I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864249&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;I got my job off a posting on Handshake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864299&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;I honestly don&amp;#x27;t believe anyone is getting jobs on linkedin anymore. Nobody.&lt;br&gt;I tried almost 2 years and sent hundreds upon hundreds of applications.&lt;br&gt;Fake jobs.&lt;br&gt;AI fake recruiters.&lt;br&gt;All bullshit man.&lt;br&gt;I got my job off a local job board finally.&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn has only one use to find you a job: post to your hundreds of connections asking if anyone can refer you to a job. It&amp;#x27;s a networking site.&lt;br&gt;I add the maximum number of connections every week in my industry targeted at companies I might want to work for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864306&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn is full of indians&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864249&lt;br&gt;handshake.firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865182&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, careerbuilder. it’s jam packed with indians but once a week I got a good lead from a mag7 recruiter and one of them hired me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865294&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;80% of job openings are fake and just HRM wasting everyone&amp;#x27;s time.&lt;br&gt;19.999999% of jobs go to nepo hire scum, so you never had a chance anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865452&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;job boards &lt;br&gt;Head hunters are the new meta. Have fun competing with 20000 AI resumes in every application tho lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865518&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;Yes. However they are private job boards for your colleges. My college has it&amp;#x27;s own job board for students and alumni and most of the postings there I&amp;#x27;ve noticed are not on LinkedIn or Indeed. Game is pay to play, it&amp;#x27;s cringe. Sorry bro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said even that isn&amp;#x27;t that helpful since those postings just take you to the hiring companies website where you still run into the same problems of competing with h1b pennies on the dollar wagies and having your resume filtered by ai to look for certain keywords and interviewing with fat liberal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867272&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865518&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865532&lt;br&gt;God why does job hunting have to be the ultimate humiliation ritual. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;start a business!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure. If I was more smart and clever and had any ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;When I see a job posting on linkedin or some other gay job board I go to the company&amp;#x27;s website and apply there directly instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;yes put your resume here many people get jobs from /biz/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867416&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865452&lt;br&gt;hey [full legal name] yo mate whatsup I am Jake Andrews and just saw your profile in one of my specialized searches. I am based out of London and studied exercise sport science and use my unique background to help connect outgoing engineers like yourself find awesome jobs. I got an amazing career opportunity as [random skill you marked on linkedin] at this awesome up and coming company based out of flyover town USA. Salary is competitive but I won&amp;#x27;t tell you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now it seems like the only way to get one through connections. No one is hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Ireland, recruiters are actually pretty good and you can build a network through them. Unfortunately I&amp;#x27;m not in Ireland now and all Irish jobs are hybrid. European based roles naturally require working fluency in another language and that&amp;#x27;s a bridge too far at the moment, even though I speak 3 other languages to various degrees&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn seems to be quite tricky to stand out through even with customised CVs (via AI) for every application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, competition and noise are both high. Personal connections are still far and away your best option (if they are an option)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867924&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed is full of scam postings, so not that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve tried welcometothejungle.com for applying to remote jobs, but since they&amp;#x27;re remote, don&amp;#x27;t really expect to get an interview - competition is still sky high since everyone&amp;#x27;s laid off now. Job market&amp;#x27;s totally fucked all around, so any workarounds you might find are already oversaturated.

What they&amp;#x27;re doing is great for the poor. All poor socialists need to move to NYC ASAP and take advantage of the New New York. We should all be buying them bus tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869354&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868918&lt;br&gt;When you go to a restaurant, you are paying their property taxes and when you pay rent you are paying the property owners property taxes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one level of abstraction so if you cannot understand this it would indicate that your IQ is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868898&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just goes to show how horrible the Republican candidate must have been that THIS was the better choice.&lt;br&gt;One of the main reasons Trump was elected was because the Democratic candidates were THAT bad (unlikable women both times)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869557&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869533&lt;br&gt;No?&lt;br&gt;Mummy Dummy just told retard Dem New Yorkers what they wanted to hear. It&amp;#x27;s literally out of a 4th grader playback for school elections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biden wanted to run again, and after that absolutely disastrous debate against Trump. Harris was the VP but never was she going to win against a man who survived an assassination attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mamdani is the just liberal version of whatever Shabbos got they need for the “local image”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Kabbalah bracelet Mamdani is a trap for retard brown libs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869813&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869669&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; islamicist loves jews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870037&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868957&lt;br&gt;Why would they not? If your landlord could charge 10% more for rent and not lose tenants, he’d already be charging 10% more for rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870052&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869014&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the politicians they own&lt;br&gt;damn if only there was something that could be done about it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870136&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is being (((misreported))) pretty hard. The property tax increase &amp;#x27;announcement&amp;#x27; is contingent on the governor rejecting a 2% municipal tax on individuals making over 1m/yr, which is bad for people using the loophole someone else mentioned of property tax avoidance. The property tax increase is a statement of the downstream effects of not implementing the proposed tax on high-income earners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re someone who truly believes they can cut $20B out of the budget instead of raising taxes, name the departments which should be cut, their current size, and what the impact of that would be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870232&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869014&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Taxing the rich is just a convenient excuse politicians use to raise taxes with the peasants .&lt;br&gt;This.&lt;br&gt;ALL taxes are ALWAYS paid by the middle class and upper middle class. &lt;br&gt;People who can&amp;#x27;t either pretend they are poor, &lt;br&gt;or people who can&amp;#x27;t hire accountants that rich hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870304&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868898&lt;br&gt;If only he was governor! Then he would tax the rich!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870627&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868970&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;puts on SLG, VNO, VICI&lt;br&gt;interesting&lt;br&gt;these all dumped except for VICI which has a massive 5Y crab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870646&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869016&lt;br&gt;I think they&amp;#x27;re still under the impression that wallst/ finance isn&amp;#x27;t doing remote work &lt;br&gt;the city will cease to exist in its current form&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870714&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868918&lt;br&gt;It’s normal, lots of apartments are owned by immigrants who got here in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Fun fact: RLUSD only has a 4x smaller market cap than Chainlink — 20 replies — 80.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866834</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866834?lm=1771435614</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:26:54 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Fun fact: RLUSD only has a 4x smaller market cap than Chainlink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866834'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 20 • Updated: 2026-02-18 17:26 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#x27;t be long until RLUSD is also above Chainlink kek baggies what a humiliation ritual when XRP chads dab on you not once but two times looool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;aw honey, you angry again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866857&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866834&lt;br&gt;That requires people actually locking up their value onto XRPL directly instead of using ripple&amp;#x27;s ethereum virtual machine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which they won&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866859&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866848&lt;br&gt;What kind of weird cope is this lmao &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866857&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s growing every day.

Same thing is going to happen with the opening of the clarity act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except when you consider that the TVL held by their oracles are 15x the current market cap of LINK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866879&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866867&lt;br&gt;I mean when that person saved it back then whoever it was, nobody knows it&amp;#x27;s all a mystery on 4chan where everybody is anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It&amp;#x27;s not me i&amp;#x27;m someone else&lt;br&gt;Kek, never change.

If the creator has been elected to the CFTC and is spearheading one of the most important clarity laws for currency adoption. What does that say for the broader market overall?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My theory is that institutions are stalling as much as possible so they can create their own private solution rather than using whats publicly available. Because that would allow for the broader market to win instead of participating in a zero sum game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867043&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866965&lt;br&gt;Being open source is one of the biggest memes where private investors can just steal what&amp;#x27;s been established and carbon copy to keep all the benefits. It&amp;#x27;s actually a tale as old as time when it comes to innovation.

It&amp;#x27;s like leveraged litecoin, but you don&amp;#x27;t own it so there are additional risks i suppose.&lt;br&gt;IF litecoin makes a comeback this will explode. also the price is less than the current litecoin treasury, so it&amp;#x27;s like buying litecoin on discount.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They&amp;#x27;re in the pharma business, trying new drugs for cancer, but at this point this becomes secondary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867751&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kek baggies, this shitcoin is going to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868276&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LTC isn&amp;#x27;t doing well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868461&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866494&lt;br&gt;its unbelievable to me that people are shilling this bitcoin ripoff decades later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868911&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866494&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;No founder holding a majority of supply&lt;br&gt;Yeah because he dumped it all at the top&lt;br&gt;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869178&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868911&lt;br&gt;saddest of all trvkes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869435&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866494&lt;br&gt;Shilling a dead coin. It&amp;#x27;s the only shitcoin that didn&amp;#x27;t even pump this entire bull market and now is worth less than 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869443&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866886&lt;br&gt;I am making a bag of it.

It&amp;#x27;s undervalued. It&amp;#x27;s always amongst crypto payments accepted currencies. It didn&amp;#x27;t pump. It will pump eventually and those price levels will never be seen again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870701&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869776&lt;br&gt;How high do you see it going.. eventually..?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The NFT scam really nuked normies interest in crypto forever — 12 replies — 48.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61870093</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61870093?lm=1771435743</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:29:03 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;The NFT scam really nuked normies interest in crypto forever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61870093'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 12 • Updated: 2026-02-18 17:29 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFT scam really nuked normies interest in crypto forever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870102&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870093&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s not a scam, he actually DOES own the monkey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870137&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870102&lt;br&gt;he owns a memory slot in mapping (uint =&amp;gt; address)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870168&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870093&lt;br&gt;That short king is plapping that woman right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870171&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870137&lt;br&gt;and your bank balance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870179&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870093&lt;br&gt;Accurate.

I interviewed with them, passed the interview and then they hired me. They asked me to fill out the job application paperwork after I already did a few interviews to &amp;quot;make it official&amp;quot;. Then I got an offer for close to 400k TC and took it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869002&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;Nobody wanted to work because covid relief was so good. You could make more on unemploymenr than working and you could put off paying a lot of your bills. Getting a job was easy if you wanted one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;I graduated with a degree in Physics in December 2019. Covid hit early 2020. I worked at a gas station for 4 months before getting factory work. I worked on the factory floor for all of covid, and only got a job in my field in 2023. It was hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not the timing, it&amp;#x27;s because they&amp;#x27;re Indian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869068&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Job hunting in 2021 is oldfag status&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;mfw when 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869072&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;I graduated a year before covid and the company I work for basically had a policy where they didn&amp;#x27;t hire new grads that didn&amp;#x27;t graduate before covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869094&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;got a random email one day asking me if I wanted to join their company, no resume or anything, and thats where I am today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;I started applaying for a new job in jan 21 and in april i landed a new one with 50% increase. After a few months i started applying again and in 22 i got a remote job with almost 100% salary increase and a more favourable taxation. This kind of leap is the easiest early in your career, it gets much more difficult later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869617&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869023&lt;br&gt;This. I took that first $120k position and ran with it. I worked my other job too though so $120k + $75k. The job laid off 30% of the company in a year though.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;It was crazy, multiple recruiters in your DMs on linkedin a day. Always got an interview if you applied. Everything was remote nearly and good pay. Feels like you were the hot HS QB for a year then you graduated, got fat and forgotten about. I went to get my PhD in the mean time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869636&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;i&amp;#x27;m an accountingfag not a techfag. that said, the job market in 2021 was very good. at the time i only had 3 YOE and i would get like 15-20 recruiter messages a month. i interviewed all over for remote jobs. today, even with more experience and several promotions to management, i&amp;#x27;m lucky to get like 5 recruiter messages a month and all of the jobs sound like shit (remote is rare.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869678&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869636&lt;br&gt;CPA here&lt;br&gt;Governmentmaxxing&lt;br&gt;Pensionmaxxing&lt;br&gt;Comfymaxxing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biggest challenge in government is once you bet high enough, you’re working closely with elected officials who have totally different perspective than normal people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869716&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;There was a massive wave of boomers taking retirement then and companies got caught with their pants down because they hadn&amp;#x27;t hired and trained anyone in decades so yeah they hired literally anyone including zoomers and the wave of indians out of panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869731&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869678&lt;br&gt;ive looked at government jobs. i wouldnt dream of working fed govt after trump fired millions of fed workers. state/local pay sucks unless youre at like the director level, but remote is rare and is always subject to some niggerfaggot politician demanding all government wagies return to the wage cage so as to pump jewish commercial real elstate bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869734&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;it was already fucked by 2020 and saturated with jeet nepo&lt;br&gt;the age of waltzing into a tech job with minimal skills and walking away rich was 90s-2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869736&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;2021 makes you an oldfag&lt;br&gt;Not for /biz/ specifically, but I wonder what these zoomers and alphoomers would think of us that have been around since like 2012&lt;br&gt;I still remember being called a newfag back then too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869892&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;What was the &amp;quot;process&amp;quot; even like for you dinosaurs? Did you just walk in, pulse check, firm handshake, and get handed a 250k TC package with stock options? &lt;br&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869908&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869002&lt;br&gt;I manage a lot of part-time people and at the time I had a few ask me to limit their hours so they could collect partial unemployment. it was a ridiculous time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869996&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;It was really easy to pump up your salary every month by switching job. Currently stuck since the market got so shit. Not mad since im still profiting. (IT fag)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870040&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still had to apply to a lot of places. Most of the places avidly hiring were shittier companies or contract roles. But I did get to vault to senior level status after only 4 years of junior because of the demand. Salary went from $78k to $126k total and I got to be fully remote. LinkedIn/Indeed were still fully useable for applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being in tech though the interview process was still shit, multi panel stuff and lots of calls and back and forth with many companies. Not too dissimilar from now except people were more eager to talk to you. I do have almost 10 years experience though so maybe that&amp;#x27;s why I&amp;#x27;m still getting bites these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870357&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869731&lt;br&gt;I’m not fed. Am director. Not remote is accurate although some places do hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870415&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;it was really nice man, lots of recruiters in your DMs all the time asking you to interview and you could leverage it pretty easily&lt;br&gt;now it&amp;#x27;s shit compared to back then but hopefully the pendulum swings back at some point&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870471&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;build something that shows dedication and that you give a fuck. doesn&amp;#x27;t need to be groundbreakingly useful, just something that took effort and that&amp;#x27;s presentable. also don&amp;#x27;t use any LLM in your resume and communication whatsoever, everyone who&amp;#x27;s literate will notice and everyone hates reading LLM slop by now. this + not being a complete shut-in will still get you hired if you&amp;#x27;re not too picky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870483&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s as hard as it is today, I barely sent 10 applications back then and got into a fortune 50 because I had good internships and references not even nepo. &lt;br&gt;I did have to do math that was probably an IQ test, videos, on-site interviews with hiring managers, tech team, etc... an before that I had idk how many calls with HR.&lt;br&gt;Most people I know just pray and spray their CVs.&lt;br&gt;Competent and socially adjusted people are the rarest thing there is. &lt;br&gt;Stop dooming and apply yourself. Literally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870489&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869678&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you’re working closely with elected officials who have totally different perspective than normal people&lt;br&gt;what do you mean by different perspective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870490&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870471&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;+ not being a complete shut-in&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s over&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870535&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;2020-2021 was ok but I remember 2017-2019 being incredibly easy when you were looking for a job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870547&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;People talk about AI ruining the job market but it was already rock bottom by around 2017. My past job hunts took 900 and 1200 applications each. AI is actually a benefit for zoomers now since you can even the odds a bit. Automate all those cover letters and application forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870547&lt;br&gt;six figure software engineer btw&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870579&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;haven&amp;#x27;t had to look for a job since 2007.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;t. 43 yo Boomer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870581&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868983&lt;br&gt;people who got hired in 2020-2022 are the first to get laid off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870584&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869002&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nobody wanted to work because covid relief was so good.&lt;br&gt;uh maybe if you compare it to minimum wage work. not a software job lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870600&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870547&lt;br&gt;It recovered by 2021 though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870600&lt;br&gt;only because of cheap covid money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>US is in recession — 30 replies — 55.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866972</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866972?lm=1771434322</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:05:22 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;US is in recession&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866972'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 30 • Updated: 2026-02-18 17:05 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;US is in recession&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866978&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;I graduated collage and got a job.

That means that what most people think of when they think &amp;quot;arts major&amp;quot; (fine arts, animation, etc.) are better-employed than criminal justice majors. They&amp;#x27;re better employed than med techs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marinate on that for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867150&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867099&lt;br&gt;Have you tried walking into google and giving Sundar a firm handshake, kiddo... That&amp;#x27;s what we used to do back in our day... Look him in the eyes and let him know you&amp;#x27;ll do whatever in takes... Extra hours, sleeping at the office... Kids these days just don&amp;#x27;t have the grit we used to have... That&amp;#x27;s why we sent men to the moon, 6 times at that, yes sir...&lt;br&gt;You gotta pay your dues, and you gotta be in it to win it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867192&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867094&lt;br&gt;A lot of people who do Criminal Justice degrees are people who watched CSI etc and want to solve murders or do forensics rather than law or general policing or whatever. The actual amount of jobs available for that field is extremely small&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;That graph is basically flatlined lol. There are things to be alarmed about, but is this really one of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867228&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do any of these stats even matter. This shit is just fud for you a couple of years now I&amp;#x27;ve been seeing so much shit like this but than nothing ever happens because of it people just move on like it doesn&amp;#x27;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867266&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867214&lt;br&gt;Tbh it shows we&amp;#x27;ve been on an unsustainable path for, at minimum, the duration of the x axis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867303&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867192&lt;br&gt;Because the laws they want to change, for the better, get rejected. We need a giga wipe of all the branches. All senators and shit, GONE. We need new blood instead of fucking 98 yr old Strom Thurman fuckers voting for shit. 2 terms, 3 years each. President only gets 2 terms, 8 years and that&amp;#x27;s it, why do THEY get to fucking stay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867341&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;This is a complete lie. Trump doubled steel production in one year.

Womp womp should have become a mechanic. Oh wait I did that too and applied to be a mechanic at the place 5 minutes up the road and they told me they already got three guys but need an inspector if I want to pay for inspection courses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know the real fucked up part? I was gonna invest 100k into BTC at 20k back in 2022. I would have been pretty much set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867546&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867228&lt;br&gt;The news just gaslights people about how millennials all somehow got 6 figure careers and some fag on /biz/ will always reply to posts like this liek &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m 36 and everyone I know is making 200k a year&amp;quot; and then will refuse to actually explain what he does or make up a fanciful story about dropshipping businesses and ebay magic, nevermind that I tried the ebay business route and that shit is too high in fees to be worth anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867341&lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t believe they did this.

It&amp;#x27;s just as gay but 22/hr and there&amp;#x27;s no real interview&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t.

He was irrelevant before he was even sworn in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870588&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867538&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I was gonna invest 100k into BTC at 20k back in 2022.

I done replied to so many mfs in recent times and noticed shit takes a negative non fuel metabolizable physical impact on you. The 1 post mfs are an issue and are becoming one more and more as of late. Please guard your insights or reservations and make sure to check for signs of good faith in the post first and whether or not its a one post id second. Good luck out there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869349&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862956&lt;br&gt;Well at least he didn&amp;#x27;t suffer did he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869355&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863411&lt;br&gt;He was hothead enough to ride at those speeds, but not enough to do a last second evading maneuver. &lt;br&gt;In the end he acted like a normie, which is brake when things to wrong. Which works most of the time, but in a CAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869395&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863410&lt;br&gt;Stop posting those image all the time fagit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869422&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;drives in the emergency lane&lt;br&gt;bikenigger got what he deserved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869527&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863253&lt;br&gt;Fucking hate people that turn like that. Like any sense of g-forces at all is completely unacceptable to feel. FUCKING GO!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When did you realize that you were NOT going to make it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Define &amp;quot;Make it&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;Good wife, one son, over a million in my Roth IRA... did I &amp;#x27;make it&amp;#x27;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869920&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868013&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;uhh source?

Have you ever met an Asian with empathy or altruism? I just don’t think their brains are capable of much so we see them as something less. There’s a reason why the Asians have no soul joke seems to stick. I don’t know maybe some Asian American can explain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870027&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;The subconscious will to die, the death drive is always present to varying degrees. It battles with the will to live. There is nothing inherently wrong with death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870172&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869948&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;doom posting with lar dee dar prose.&lt;br&gt;Just doesn&amp;#x27;t bring me happiness m8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870204&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863182 &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922 &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This guy was going 2x the speed limit on the shoulder. 100% deserved.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869926&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Friendly reminder&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; motorbikes have 100x the fatality rate of cars, given enough time you&amp;#x27;re basically guaranteed to have a serious accident with one&lt;br&gt;This. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He should have realized when he bought a bike. &lt;br&gt;Then decided to go 2x speed limit on a shoulder .&lt;br&gt;This is a very common scenario, someone is turning right into a parking lot, without seeing some retard doing 2x on a shoulder lane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually know a person who survived this one. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;his bike had a bigger engine , he flew OVER a car&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870288&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868079&lt;br&gt;ID probably changed because mac addr recycle, but I appreciate the effort post anon&lt;br&gt;While the bad faith posters will inevitably harvest some portion of loosh from me, as I still retain my (admittedly damaged) spirit, my comments are not necessarily for direct reply: they are also for those passive scrollers and anons who have visited this site for years and never typed a single reply or started a single thread. The silent lurkers, for which any morsel of knowledge may enlighten or ease their spiritual burden by a miniscule amount, is to whom I make these comments hidden far away from the mass of crowds who trample all over fragile truth for vulgar and banal platitudes. Godspeed, anon.

I would ask for nothing else&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861591&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I am from D.C.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s full of drones. Some are deluded enough to think being the GS-15 in charge of whatever the fuck department for whatever government agency actually makes them important.&lt;br&gt;It doesn&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858990&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;IMAGINE LIVING IN A BROWN SHITHOLE&lt;br&gt;D.C. suburbs in 2012 be like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862146&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;Los Angeles is a shithole. San Francisco lost all sovl because no one who lives there is actually from San Francisco anymore. D.C. is literally a dilapidated nigger den. New York is cool and iconic but is also a lonely hive where everyone is disconnected despite living 10,000 to a city block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think you&amp;#x27;ve been to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859319&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;worst street&lt;br&gt;So you admit that the left-wing billionaires delegate certain streets for the homeless while they live on the nice streets in their high rises, with private security?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862164&lt;br&gt;They delegate entire states for the washed out retards to live in, while even the homeless here in LA have more upward mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862210&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Non-Americans&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Main Character&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Even Once&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861591&lt;br&gt;This. I&amp;#x27;m from DC too, but I left that shithole years ago. Everyone is a bureaucratic suit who aspires to work for the government or some adjacent entity. Sure there might be ethnic diversity, but there is no cultural diversity at all. Quite literally everyone is a libtard. Not to mention the women there are not only busted but also extremely deluded in thinking that they deserve Chads. A DC 10 is a Miami or NYC 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862537&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859324&lt;br&gt;Can confirm, LA is great. Every month I have to remember to not self-dox because retards are talking about what a shithole it is here, and I want to take a photo of my window view showing that it looks exactly the same as the white southern suburb they all fantasize about. Just don&amp;#x27;t live in the poor part of town. That rule applies to every city on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have *real* mexican food for cheap, no bad weather, and as many asian women and big booty latinas as you could ever want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862380&lt;br&gt;D.C. has long been &amp;quot;Hollywood for ugly people.&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s where ugly people go to make it - with their 6 figure bullshit government job.&lt;br&gt;I lived in Fairfax and worked in Arlington - at least I wasn&amp;#x27;t on the nigger side of the Potomac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864233&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;These places are all horrible unless you’re rich or are on a clear path to wealth. I’m convinced the only places left on earth where it’s still possible to safely and comfortably raise a family on a middling firstie income are Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (the Catholic ones in the EU not the orthodox shitholes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864442&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Eastern Europe&lt;br&gt;Can confirm it&amp;#x27;s comfy as fuck here with just a few hundred grand of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864757&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862146&lt;br&gt;Erm but all my favorite movies take place in those cities so they must be the best and most important in America!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864780&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;most of those cities suck ass and are basically open air prisons for white collar wageslaves. people with money &amp;quot;in LA&amp;quot; live on or near the beach. people with money &amp;quot;in DC&amp;quot; live in surrounding areas like bethesda or chevy chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864816&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I enjoy Manhattan and visiting SOCAL but living there would be too much. I lived on in Santa Monica for a year and anytime you&amp;#x27;d want to do something you had to plan around traffic. Not a way to live you entire life. There&amp;#x27;s a ton of great nature in southern California so even if you&amp;#x27;re not into le hustle and bustle you&amp;#x27;re still able to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868506&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;wow gringos are really fucking retarded, who gives a fuck about your shitty cities??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869839&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;Swap Los Angeles for Denver and that list is accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s no surplus of 20-29 year old white women in LA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861595&lt;br&gt;NIGGER THIS IS THE COSTCO IN MONTGOMERY VILLAGE MD, GTFO MY VILLAGE NIGGA LONG LIVE 9 RUGA GANG FOR LIFE. LOVE LIVE TAY, FREE BIG AHK. FUCK GTOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869882&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are places for people who already got rich to move to. Who became the main character in the vast opportunities available elsewhere starting from little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poor people and wagies who immediately move there are actually doomed to a lifetime of NPC servitude. You are the background noise and lifeless bodies that the actual rich main characters have to step around in their new map. You just think you&amp;#x27;re a main character because you&amp;#x27;re proximal to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870054&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859145&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;BIG PLACE GOOD&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s it? That&amp;#x27;s your argument?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859324&lt;br&gt;The chud memes are exaggerated, but the economic reality for the vast majority of people is that living in a major metro is basically impossible unless you live like a fucking rat with a hald dozen roommates. Big cities are full of rich people not because that&amp;#x27;s how you get rich and make connections, but because they&amp;#x27;re the only ones that can afford to live there. And the wealth and connections come naturally, when you have lots of rich people together. Big cities are effectively playgrounds for the top 20%, and open air prisons for the rest who work 3 wagie jobs and still can&amp;#x27;t afford rent or utilities and live to serve their rich masters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re already rich then you&amp;#x27;re right: nothing beats a major primary city. More contacts and networking, more opportunities, more fun, more wage slaves to pleasure you. Secondary and tertiary, smaller cities are potentially good for middle income people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>EVERYTHING IS DUMPING AGAIN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WILL EVER FUCKING GO UP IN PRICE — 31 replies — 27.7/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863721</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863721?lm=1771432236</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:30:36 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;EVERYTHING IS DUMPING AGAIN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WILL EVER FUCKING GO UP IN PRICE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863721'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 31 • Updated: 2026-02-18 16:30 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING IS DUMPING AGAIN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WILL EVER FUCKING GO UP IN PRICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863739&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863721&lt;br&gt;Sure, the cost of living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863742&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863721&lt;br&gt;Everything has gone up like crazy, thank god if it dumps so you can finally invest again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863768&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863739&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s because goyim keep wanting more and more. Self-imposed suffering. You want sex? No one owes it to you. You want a livable wage? No one owes it to you. You want a livable space? No one owes it to you. You want food? No one owes it to you. All your wants and needs have been outsourced to other people for convenience. You could instead hobomaxx. Own nothing and be happy. Stop reproducing and perpetuating the cycle of endless wants and needs. But no, you filthy goyim insist on suffering and condemning others to suffering too.

THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX.
