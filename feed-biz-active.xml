Expecting Chinese to stop subsidising their industry is akin to asking Americans to stop eating Burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875528&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875497&lt;br&gt;Huh no kidding, I hadn’t been paying much attention to that. One thing I will be keeping an eye on is the EU pension crisis and how that’s managed because I personally don’t see a smooth exit from that situation, especially in France. Looking into it, I guess Germany has a similar problem, which I wouldn’t have guessed based on their debt. What’s your take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875121&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s between 6 and 8 Yuan so it&amp;#x27;s still tied to the dollar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875517&lt;br&gt;Well, my point was that by managing the currency in order to keep it low, it makes exports more attractive, which results in a huge surplus. If the yuan floated freely, this would eventually correct. A huge trade surplus would mean more demand for the yuan and it would strengthen the currency. However, China doesn’t let this happen. If the currency strengthens or threatens to strengthen beyond what they deem desirable, they weaken their currency by selling yuan or by setting a lower daily exchange rate. This is the advantage of a managed currency, but it also means that it pisses everyone off when their own exports aren’t as competitive or their domestic industries suffer. China claims that they don’t this to the extent that they’re accused of, and it definitely comes in waves of egregiousness, but it seems like they’re back at it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, it’s true they’re good at exporting, but their insane trade surplus is in part the result of what I’m describing (an undervalued yuan that is kept undervalued by china’s central bank).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875564&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873590&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;call western &amp;quot;social democracies&amp;quot; capitalist&lt;br&gt;We are 10 times more communist than china... with an extra helping of suicidal democracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875527&lt;br&gt;China doesn&amp;#x27;t subsidize their industries though&lt;br&gt;They just do things better and have more affordable standards of living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875583&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873819&lt;br&gt;Wtf I love China now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875617&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875554&lt;br&gt;It can be undervalued and tied to the dollar. Read my post. You seem to think that because a currency’s exchange rate hasn’t changed that it can’t be undervalued or overvalued. That’s not true. Its real value in terms of purchasing power could rise and the central bank could artificially exert downward pressure (which would mean that the exchange rate would stay roughly the same over time). This is exactly what China has been accused of forever, and the issue is that China issue exactly forthcoming with their economic data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is obviously tied to the dollar. It is not STRICTLY PEGGED to the dollar. Every day the PBOC sets the exchange rate. The argument is that this rate hasn’t changed and has remained too low for how much demand there is for the yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875625&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875528&lt;br&gt;Well they&amp;#x27;re definitely going to bail the pension system out, but it should be kind of mitigated by the military and infrastructure spending because of their domestic industry. Adding money to those sectors should hypothetically cause more younger people to make more money, increasing direct contributions to the pension system. The bet that they&amp;#x27;re taking is that the spending won&amp;#x27;t increase inflation as much as it will improve the economic situation, which has some merit because Germany and even the rest of the EU have considerably lower debt to GDP than China or the US, and the currency has been appreciating broadly over the past few years giving them room for increased spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875629&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875572&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of them are subsidised. They do not call them as subsidies but different names. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: Ran a Business sourcing products from multiple suppliers in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875657&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873690&lt;br&gt;A communist dictator that values his people and his country will absolutely make any system built on jewish corruption look bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875675&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875625&lt;br&gt;Interesting, good take. Definitely a situation to watch, particularly how the bailout happens. Getting a handle on youth unemployment, especially in France, should help, yeah. Realistically, I wonder if the pension system will be continued for much longer moving forward, and I think the French will lose their shit if it’s reformed in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;China now rises to take the world stage because the west was reckless and retarded with their wealth. They relied on Chinas cheap exports too much and now suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876792&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875124&lt;br&gt;Yes, the pride comes before the fall. As it always has throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875563&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an interesting theory that borders on coping strategy because it makes currency seem much more important than the worthless shit it is. Yuan floating or not floating does not change the fact that China manufactures everything that&amp;#x27;s not manufactured elsewhere. The currency that is used in the exchange of goods does not change that fact. The unfloating of yuan would not teleport all the CNC mills, supply chains, and millions of workers into Tennessee or Germany. Currency can ligma balls or be infinitely expensive compared to other currencies, it does not matter. It may seem that it does, but it does not. Fixed currency makes exchange of goods easier, and manufacturers can plan more easily. Exchange rates are annoying, that&amp;#x27;s true. China eliminated that headache. It&amp;#x27;s a right decision, but nowhere near the most important decision they made to be the best at everything that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876956&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874655&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the US can literally print the oil price into the ground&lt;br&gt;it can&amp;#x27;t actually. Picrel. Being able to produce 70% of the all physical things on Earth give you the ability to print whatever you want WITHOUT inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876956&lt;br&gt;midwit take. they avoid inflation by having an iron grip on capital flows. they essentially cheat the impossible trinity model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877010&lt;br&gt;in that case, why don&amp;#x27;t North Korea/Cuba/Russia print 1 trillion dollars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877115&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875572&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875564&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874440&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sincerely hope you&amp;#x27;re just too young or pol-brained to know any better, but just in case you aren&amp;#x27;t:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chinese state does not give out money (or make sure other financiers are available to give out money) in order to create productive, competitive industry. They do it for 2 reasons:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It lets them massively overproduce a good (solar panels, EVs, E-bikes, ect...) at a loss in order to crush foreign manufacturing bases and corner the production&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It helps ensure employment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the reason for the boondoggle that has been OBOR is that it meant the Chinese could use central Asia as a dumping ground for all of the dogshit concrete and steel they were churning out at a loss for years. There wasn&amp;#x27;t an appetite for that much material when they were making it, and they knew it. Export profits were not the point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2nd point is the bigger deal. Basically, for a long time, the deal in China was that so long as the average guy could get a job if he wanted one, and didn&amp;#x27;t make too much noise, things would get better. The CCP revolution that conquered the country was built on jobless, angry people, and the guys running the CCP did not want to be on the other end of that deal. Therefore, the CCP is willing to subsidize terrible business that are guaranteed to lose money, so long as they can promise jobs. The problem these days is that youth unemployment is high and climbing and the increasingly small share of the Chinese population that is young is more and more dissatisfied with living in a PvE server as the E.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;61876817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;best at everything that matters&lt;br&gt;What a funny way to say, &amp;quot;polluted their soil, water, and air so thoroughly that not even their party members are able to avoid bone marrow cancer anymore.&amp;quot; You would think that they would just incinerate the waste solvents from all the REE processing like Victorian industrialists, but I guess it was 0.000003 RMB cheaper per ton to just dump it into the nearest waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877159&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877115&lt;br&gt;Ameri fat Kool aid&lt;br&gt;USAID mental gymnastics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877162&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877115&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;OBOR boondoggle&lt;br&gt;opinion discarded.

Cotton was being grown in fields contaminated with heavy metals, which is relatively fine since the fibers won&amp;#x27;t get consumed. Then the order came down to convert cotton fields to grain. The only reason that anyone noticed a problem is that cadmium poisoning causes rapid onset joint pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But none of that can top the hilarity of deleting literally millions of infants between 1980 and 2015, then turning around and being utterly shocked at running out of young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877210&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877206&lt;br&gt;we&amp;#x27;re talking about the only place that can make hdmi cables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877217&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cotton fields&lt;br&gt;are all in Xinjiang, which btw produces the absolute best cotton in the world. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;growing grains in Xinjiang&lt;br&gt;ror&lt;br&gt;rmao even&lt;br&gt;do you even read what you wrote and see how retarded you sound?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;environmental protection&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in 2026&lt;br&gt;Are we really going to pretend that this matters at all anymore?

He looks like a gay nerd because he is one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;You will be waiting forever if you expect to be saved by fixing structural issues.

Which is why Henry Ford literally wrote a book about them. And the Dodge Brothers sued his ass because he was looking out for his employees not shareholders.

They literally call him a fascist for preaching financial responsibility, lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873140&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;create media product showcasing idiocy of goyim&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;get popular &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cash in &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;Or there&amp;#x27;s an issue in the educational system that produced several generations of financial illiterates that can&amp;#x27;t say no to thrice daily starbucks, avocado toast, $3k iphones, $90k trucks, and semiannual $20k vacations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874332&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873139&lt;br&gt;The leftoids want people to be poor because poor people vote for the leftoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874447&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;The problem IS how high interest rates are. People are fucking BNPLing consumer staples and groceries, no one owns anything and are using credit cards to pay bills. Caleb is not a leftist and OP is a massive faggot for defending usury which should be banned and its purveyors should be tried for treason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876211&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873117&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This is nigger logic and it almost never works out.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the only thing that works.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873133&lt;br&gt;How&amp;#x27;s Tel Aviv?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876215&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873914&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#x27;re saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice how individuals are considered the irresponsible ones, and not the governments that devalue the currency so that it&amp;#x27;s fucking worthless? Why doesn&amp;#x27;t (((Caleb))) talk about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876222&lt;br&gt;Or the institutions that charge usury-level interest, that&amp;#x27;s another point I should add&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873088&lt;br&gt;You, as an individual, will never, ever fix the system and the chances of a revolution sweeping along to do so, which by the way will just have some other bullshit attached, is slim to none and slim just left town. That leaves you alone, in the system, to &amp;quot;cope&amp;quot;. How will you do that? By reading the rules and bending them enough to make you prosperous within its confines. Everything else is a fuckkng pipe dream and you will just waste years toiling in it when you could have been making it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats what faggots who blame the system do. They give up. They dont have the fortitude. They dont put in &amp;quot;the hard work&amp;quot; to bend the rules and make them selves prosperous. They just drag everyone else down into thier level of misery out of envy. Dont be that fucking loser. Be the guy who makes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876247&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;Despite being a fat faggot, leftists hate Caleb Hammer for making the hateful claim that you shouldn&amp;#x27;t buy junk when you have to get a 150% APY loan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876259&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;retard takes a loan with 50% interest rate to buy some burritos at chipotle and labubus&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;completely oblivious about what loan interests means&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ITS NOT A BAD DECISION, ITS THE FAULT OF LE EVIL CAPITALISM&lt;br&gt;lmao holy fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876262&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876259&lt;br&gt;You shouldn&amp;#x27;t even be able to take out a loan at 50% kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkw21YfvpBk&amp;amp;t=927s&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally ends with &amp;quot;ahhh cool story, stand against the wall....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876302&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;There isn’t a structural issue.

I instantly know there is a schizo take coming when i read this. Some schizo takes are interesting, some are even good, some are good to think through and some are just funny to read. But they stzill are schizo takes and mostly bullshit influeces too much by wish bias. So how and where did this phrase pick up with schizos. When i know, its around 2021/2022 when the schizo&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;economy will collapse and people will starve due to lockdowns&lt;br&gt;did not materialize. Then they started with this phrase to somehow save their prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873806&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no less than three seething replies about muh real capitalism&lt;br&gt;If you abolished the state it would be reinvented by the wealthy overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;Fake and gay was in use when I 1st started using this site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873988&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Hopefully never because I have a fake overpaid job, just not in HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876439&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872064&lt;br&gt;And prevent White women from breeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877263&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;everyone wants to be rich without doing jack shit, jews are just more succesful at the game and more honest about what the game is, maybe because they invented it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there are less and less people talking about &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;value&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in a real way, no one believes in it, no one believes that value is real or there is merit to providing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;everything is about winning or losing, and brother let me tell you, I&amp;#x27;m not gonna be one of the cucks who focuses on helping society or building when I can make my money sitting in my computer and playing the money game, the money game is more fun and rewarding than going to medical or engineering school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;go in to interview for a technical role&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;see vidrel being filmed in the hallway on your way in&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the job pays well&lt;br&gt;wat do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872085&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872087&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872278&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;REAL capitalism has never been tried&lt;br&gt;This is real capitalism, and it&amp;#x27;s retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>the US is in recession — 43 replies — 16.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61869320</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61869320?lm=1771571030</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 07:03:50 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;the US is in recession&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61869320'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 43 • Updated: 2026-02-20 07:03 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;the US is in recession&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869343&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;doomed fag nation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adjust by population&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869389&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;There are so many job positions available people can get 2 of them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Recession&lt;br&gt;If anything business-is-a-boomin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870808&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;The economy has never been better.

Delivering Pizzas though was working with friends and we would smoke pot and drink beers, didn&amp;#x27;t feel like work really.&lt;br&gt;This was in the aftermath of 2008, during 2009/10 I did that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869517&lt;br&gt;3 days a week is not a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872729&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;think&lt;br&gt;*know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872903&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870845&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;defining a recession by the fucking dictionary&lt;br&gt;stupid nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872909&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s been in recession since two thousand fucking eight &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;they just can&amp;#x27;t hide it anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872927&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872563&lt;br&gt;36+ hours is a full time job, retard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874552&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am one of those assholes.

Seriously you can&amp;#x27;t ask for a raise and give me one of your jobs? Then you mock me for failing to get a job? You are hogging 2 jobs. If you didn&amp;#x27;t work 2 jobs there would be room for unemployed people to have jobs too. Boomer X fuckers still don&amp;#x27;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;I hope you’re trolling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877277&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869343&lt;br&gt;as long as wagies keep waging, it aint doomed nigga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;People are working two or more jobs and you call this recession?

Some are right in the data here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872698&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gold for example has a higher average annual return, better risk adjusted return, and a 0.1 correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;All on btc shorts. Outperform those gay indexes for the next three years in one week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;Why do you focus on yield so much instead of total returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a lot of US large cap equity exposure with tax inefficiency if it&amp;#x27;s in a taxable account. You&amp;#x27;ll get big dividend though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like PTY, ASGI, etc for yield personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873145&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872998&lt;br&gt;no it fucking doesn&amp;#x27;t, in the last 110 years it has returned 5% while the stock market returned 10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873145&lt;br&gt;ik this is probably bait but that&amp;#x27;s a very silly time period to look at because before we got off the gold standard it was fixed ounces/USD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaning 0% growth for half that period dragging the CAGR way down lol. Doesn&amp;#x27;t make sense to look at the return pre Nixon shock for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;if you like uncorrelated risk adjusted-returns you should look at alternative investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;Returns are totally dependent on the managers imho, it&amp;#x27;s a cool class. I&amp;#x27;m not a huge fan of the illiquidity personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do like some of them them, especially private farmland/timberland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not a huge fan of venture or growth PE, guess I&amp;#x27;m lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873207&lt;br&gt;have you looked into managed futures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873080&lt;br&gt;I use my brokerage as my main savings account. Instead of getting $500/month in a high yield savings account I rather get $1400, 50-75% I could reinvest. But since you do this for a living I&amp;#x27;m going to listen and allocate more money for growth rather than yield going forward, and you&amp;#x27;re right about the taxes, I didn&amp;#x27;t think too much about that. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873214&lt;br&gt;I cant believe I forgot about those!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use the ETFs for simplicity. ISMF/CTA for crisis alpha. I almost went DBMF too, but I prefer the purer systematic trend heavy ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you have any strong opinions on them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like extreme negative correlation, like -0.4 with 6-8% CAGR which is completely acceptable if you&amp;#x27;re rebalancing with a really aggressive equity portfolio. I considered pairing them with TQQQ or SOXL to be a total jackass at once point and pussed out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873231&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873220&lt;br&gt;You accept more risk (volatility) for those higher returns, that&amp;#x27;s the tradeoff. If you are OK with higher risk then you could always choose one of those balanced allocation funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOR for example just rebalances a 60% stock / 40% bond index portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOA does the same thing but 80% stock (more risk)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These really are the easy button for people that don&amp;#x27;t want to self-manage imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably a good idea to put the portion that&amp;#x27;s your emergency fund into something boring and very lowvol but decent yield. Check out JPST, that might be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873222&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;those are the returns for my managed futures program, im a CTA. its great uncorrelated returns but theres a lot of programs that under perform or blow up (-60%+ years). its definitely more liquid than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873270&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873256&lt;br&gt;Damn dude you&amp;#x27;re crushing it. What&amp;#x27;s the time period on those returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind if I ask what your strategy is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any specific managed futures ETFs you like? Are they even close to replicating the actuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873270&lt;br&gt;thats 20 months of performance trading 8 different futures markets. semi-systematic medium frequency trend following. im not too familiar with the ETFs that track managed futures but they usually focus on the billion dollar CTAs and those programs are lower returns lower risk just trying to be uncorrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873448&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873184&lt;br&gt;ok, its still not beating the stock market unlike your claim, and if you take the last 3 years out and it drops a lot. That is insane volatility that it doesn&amp;#x27;t converge after 50 years. Realistically the actual return is maybe 7% and you get very long periods of dogshit ~3%, and for all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m currently halfway through finishing my CFP course&lt;br&gt;Any advice for someone trying to hit the ground running, beyond spamming LinkedIn? Or should I just accept that this job market is going to rape me until I give up hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Cant ai just do most of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;This. Almost tooka financial advisor job. Then I realized, &amp;quot;why the fuck would anybody talk to a human about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Cause the AI will tell you something plausible that it thinks you want to hear, and it will partially or mostly hallucinate the data it uses to deliver that response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Do you hold any bitcoin? What are your thoughts on it and does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874040&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872561&lt;br&gt;I am a europoor(in a very poor country) so I dont think i have access to most the stuff you are listing. I can only buy ETFs, I have most my portfolio in a Global market cap ETF some in europe ETF and a little in small cap value international and emerging markets. Also bought a sizable stack of silver sub 30 dollars but its going to be a bitch to sell. I dont invest in bonds since I think that every government will just keep on printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874046&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873450&lt;br&gt;Connections are everything, and the exam will be easier than you think. The classes were hugely valuable, were harder and more useful than my master&amp;#x27;s degree courses. Most companies will have you try to peddle shit insurance products to friends/family at the entry level it&amp;#x27;s gross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Maybe someday, not right now. For what &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873827 said and because it just sucks at answering niche or complex questions. When I ask it things it usually feeds me flat out wrong answers that would be passable to someone that didn&amp;#x27;t do any research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example is having it try to pick stocks. Gets obliterated by the index funds every time. It&amp;#x27;s a consistent loser at this because it can&amp;#x27;t make forward projections and the question is too complicated for it. Tax questions are a horror show too, you&amp;#x27;d think it would be good at those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main issue with AI in my eyes is that it just doesn&amp;#x27;t understand humans/human nature. Most of my job is behavioral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;I do, I made a bunch of money in it 2016ish and now build and rebalance a position in my retirement accounts (5-10% allocation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874061&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874040&lt;br&gt;Wish I knew more about EU investing, I&amp;#x27;m completely specialized for US investing so it&amp;#x27;s out of my wheelhouse. I only have a handful of expat/foreign clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EU bonds have been zero or even negative for a long time. I won&amp;#x27;t touch them because they don&amp;#x27;t compensate you for loaning them money, and I can&amp;#x27;t believe people keep buying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently it has something to do with their SIPC insurance equivalent, safer park for cash than a checking account basically because of the federal coverage you get by buying a bond. I haven&amp;#x27;t looked much into it just what I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgot to answer this part. We don&amp;#x27;t buy it in our portfolios, but we do help clients manage the risk associated with it. Some people are believers in crypto so we highlight the risks (volatility, no intrinsic value, etc) and then work with them to figure out how much of their overall investments is a prudent amount to put into that risk asset. I personally cap myself at 10% for both gold and crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto is actually considered speculation instead of investing by most managers. Kind of like commodities/gold/NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874261&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873448&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;its still not beating the stock market &lt;br&gt;It does in the 26-year backward looking period in the data array from the picture by 30bp. Instead of just pulling 7% out of your booty you could spend 10 seconds doing the present value calculation if you really wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s about 9.8% annualized if you go all the way back to &amp;#x27;71 from now ($39-$5,000). That&amp;#x27;s definitely nothing to scoff at when constructing a portfolio and hedging equity markets considering the 0.1 correlation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;That is insane volatility&lt;br&gt;Volatility is good in a portfolio of non-correlated assets that&amp;#x27;s rebalanced outside of tolerance bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market&lt;br&gt;Almost keeps up with it and doesn&amp;#x27;t move in the same direction, which is the idea. Non-correlated assets, rebalancing the volatility, and risk-return tradeoff are portfolio construction 101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874286&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright anon, I&amp;#x27;m out. Have a great day and I hope every one of you gets to retire early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS long nursing homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874295&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Is there a gap in the asset management &amp;amp; financial planning software market? Seems you are just using an excel sheet there. Is there any way your life could be easier or more automated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a developer and I like money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874345&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874295&lt;br&gt;The software is pretty comprehensive and generally way deeper than just an excel sheet, but of course there&amp;#x27;s an industry spectrum of how deep/detailed the analysis goes by firm and by program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some is straight up basically a cash flows projection laid on top of a balance sheet (excel). The people that use this are shitty whole life insurance people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the auxiliary software where the money is at right now it seems. AI that reads trusts using OCR and spits out a summary to help you find issues. Tax software. Stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our software for portfolio management (have used 3) is AWFUL though. That&amp;#x27;s a big gap for asset management imho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876336&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874261&lt;br&gt;Im sorry but your sample size is not big enough. The volatility and nature of the distribution of gold prices (its not normally distributed) means you have to be very careful about inferring information about long term returns. For example if you look at gold as an asset just 5 years ago you get very different conclusions. &lt;br&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo If the data changes heavily based on the precise dates or periods that you choose it indicates it hasn&amp;#x27;t converged to an acceptable error margin yet. 7% is a guess at what an average random sample period would be given that they can range from ~3% to ~9% or w/e but idk, im not gonna do your job for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simple sanity check should tell you that an asset that doesn&amp;#x27;t produce or do much of anything shouldn&amp;#x27;t outperform real cash generating businesses and companies in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877215&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you Jewish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>BTC dumping?

If you wanna max it, look into dual staking.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876868&lt;br&gt;Not worth it for you maybe. Some people like stacking extra sats quietly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877290&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876854&lt;br&gt;I already laid out the options. If you care about self custody, stick to routes where you keep the keys and the rules are enforced on chain. From there it’s your call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877291&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876887&lt;br&gt;OG spotted.

I guess they liked how ads work already where they pay nothing to the end user and get to program them to miscegenate and eat poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875982&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875908&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875915&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875923&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875927&lt;br&gt;whats the usecase for this shit when everybody already uses adblockers and doesn&amp;#x27;t wanna watch ads for your 0.00001 cents worth of crypto?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is a smart idea on paper but fucking stupid in physical reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875923&lt;br&gt;Good fucking point. The ICO was fucked as well. The longer I hold the more this seems like a cash grab desu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876025&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875908&lt;br&gt;There’s a reason why Brendan is only casually mentioned in the Epstein files and BAT is a completely and utterly useless memecoin scam. He is actually a principled man and doesn’t wanna get compromised by Jewish sexpest glowniggers. Turns out he really is the biggest brain in crypto and he won’t be doing anything with BAT until all these disgusting uncouth kikes are long gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876038&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876025&lt;br&gt;Trvth Svpernova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876042&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876025&lt;br&gt;Wait this ain&amp;#x27;t a nvke how are you defending a guy for being in the files. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yikes that&amp;#x27;s a bad look sweetie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876043&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875982&lt;br&gt;Jeets will watch SAR, very good customers who doing the needful, please understand sar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876047&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember when baggies used to pay you money to use Brave?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can use a dogshit browser with barely-functioning adblocker and MAKE money oh boy im sure this isnt a scam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876088&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876042&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;how are you defending a guy for being in the files.&lt;br&gt;They couldn’t get him on the island.
