I thought i was acting normalfag and friendly.. is it my eyes or what? Or is it because i&amp;#x27;m single? Fuck waging. I hope whoever slighted me dies slow and in extreme pain. Does anybody know this feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;normies are very good at detecting autism, they have a 99%+ accuracy rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its because youre single and a man. Single women are treated fine but single men are treated like homosexuals and rapists.

The sheer number of dipshits that believe whatever their favorite Youtuber says might suggest otherwise, but that&amp;#x27;s really just a testament to how prolific skilled actors have become.&lt;br&gt;You can detect &amp;quot;soul&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;soulless&amp;quot; in content the same way. You spot AI images the same way, and you used to spot Photoshopped images the same way.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I thought i was acting normalfag and friendly&lt;br&gt;Yeah, people can tell you&amp;#x27;re putting an inordinate amount of effort into acting &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. They notice that you&amp;#x27;re not comfortable, and that makes them suspicious. It&amp;#x27;s a catch-22. You want to follow the social script, but you adhere to your image of it too strictly. Because you don&amp;#x27;t actually, in action, understand it. This is because you were not &amp;quot;properly socialized&amp;quot; as a child &amp;lt;- that&amp;#x27;s what people mean when they talk about socializing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907652&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;its a combination of signals not just one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;Fuck what they think, anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907712&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who gives a fuck. Stop worrying so much. Just remember the Pepe toasting. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907735&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;You are being socially rejected/ isolated. It hurts for the first few years upto a decade but gets better after you go through the extreme mental suffering that makes you delve into deeper parts of yourself until you grow into a different person. It&amp;#x27;s not just other people who don&amp;#x27;t like you but time itself dosen&amp;#x27;t like your biology, the very crux of existence, that we are both alive and dead at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907740&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907603&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;Or it could just be your negativity. Hatred of &amp;quot;normies&amp;quot; shines through the act and turns people away within seconds of interacting with you.&lt;br&gt;...You&amp;#x27;re not one of those faggots that only ever talk about things they hate, are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908479&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Be treated by others as a beast&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Be a furry because it&amp;#x27;s fun to imagine that I actually am and not just a broken human&lt;br&gt;I think I would actually be better-accepted if I was a towering, hulking animal man, built for inspiring lizard-brain fear and distrust. Less dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908493&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907385&lt;br&gt;Because we used to be their overlords in ancient societies. People with autism and the best overseers of golden age civilizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jewish psychopaths are the antagonist of us autists and have taken over as the overlords and have made it their mission to program the normies to hate us because we are the biggest threat to world Jewry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908514&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a 3 usually but became a 5 for a few days until they shipped me off to the funny farm&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only way for non-neurotypicals to unironically make it (not have a black nurse when we are on death&amp;#x27;s door) is to start your own business. Yes your business can be trading but if you do you have to take it seriously and stop gambling with your main bucket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why is all of Gen Z number 4? &lt;br&gt;Also OP, you can tell if someone gooned recently. Normies don&amp;#x27;t know what they are sensing but I know that sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908601&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908479&lt;br&gt;Faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908672&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908493&lt;br&gt;So sad Germany lost WW2 I curse those British and American cucks for putting us in this hell ruled by the juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908673&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;you have to love yourself, you can&amp;#x27;t trick the soul matrix system genuinely love yourself and the matrix will love you back unironically - they can sense your arrogant aura and your inner toxicity normies aren&amp;#x27;t dumb they&amp;#x27;re acting subconsciously they feel what they feel but they don&amp;#x27;t even realise it they still feel it though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908726&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;Fucking manager asked me to “open up more” for the 5th time this year. Like nigger get a fucking clue. I don’t want to be a normalfag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;I hope your situation greatly improves, soon. I haven&amp;#x27;t experienced what you have so far. Tend to avoid joking/teasing at the expense of others, even the light kind other people in their life do, fully expecting that jokes/teases will be made about them. Apparently this makes me seem strangely, even suspiciously nice. Tend to tell people I&amp;#x27;ve seen how jokes/teases can come to mind again and contribute to a person&amp;#x27;s doom spiral. I&amp;#x27;ve seen people behind doom spiral just by talking while the rest listened. After that they usually get why I watch my words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909198&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908514&lt;br&gt;Good image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909269&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908726&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I have an extraordinarily stimulating home, family, and social life outside of work, and I try to support and bring a focused atmosphere in the office.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clique at the office is toxic. It doesn&amp;#x27;t matter how nice and inclusive they are on the outside, the point of being in their little in-group is so they feel accepted and trusted by you, so they can strategize around what vulnerabilities they learn about you through &amp;quot;socialization&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s also important to realize the clique at the office will not be composed of the most senior and productive workers. It will be largely &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; people to the corporation, who are trying to compound and roll the freshman happy-go-lucky &amp;quot;I made it&amp;quot; vibes perpetually.&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, being a simpleton and going with the crowd at work is a way to reduce your own role, executive actions, and relevance in your life. If 20 people have to walk together and get coffee every day because.. it&amp;#x27;s what they do...they&amp;#x27;re essentially automatons, preprogrammed. If you&amp;#x27;re forced to walk at an uncomfortably brisk pace to keep up with the lead Alpha Team Member on your walks, you&amp;#x27;re being actively cucked&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OP, you should be satisfied in knowing you don&amp;#x27;t fit in. You probably don&amp;#x27;t want to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909282&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;I have a fairly unfriendly face. Keeps me from ever moving up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909303&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;Normalfags at work don&amp;#x27;t seem to like that I need peace and quiet to do work (I usually like to find a nice chill spot to code) and they say I&amp;#x27;m not a &amp;quot;cultural fit&amp;quot;. Pretty gay and retarded if you ask me desu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61910258&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s your bodylangage. You are uptight. And tense. Alert in a way. That scream insecurities. &lt;br&gt;Seeing your post, plan to isolate from normies in the future. Solitary job or financial independance. You are too far gone. It&amp;#x27;s not a bad thing by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61910271&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908726&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I don’t want to be a normalfag.&lt;br&gt;So don&amp;#x27;t work in an office. &lt;br&gt;Do a SOLITARY job. Yes, they exist. And if you cannot find one with enough imagination, guess what, you have a little bit of normalfagging in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61910291&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908866&lt;br&gt;Normies do not understand irony. So it&amp;#x27;s useless using irony with them, in order to subtetly pass as the smart guy. Do not joke with them. Always take them seriously. They do not want to think. To learn, to understand. They want to have immediate pleasure. Eating. Drinking. Go away for the week end. Never talk to them about profound subject. Never talk to them about politics. In fact, only talk to them about the most basic shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61910319&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908567&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Why is all of Gen Z number 4? &lt;br&gt;They&amp;#x27;re all unironically retarded. It&amp;#x27;s probably a mix of 1 &amp;amp; 4, bad eyelid genes, accelerated aging, and being high. Simple interactions stress them, they&amp;#x27;re like chihuahuas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61910322&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907350&lt;br&gt;It is unironically what they are best at. Find the one not like the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>$120,000 a year is $10,000 a month.

I was a fuck up but decided to put my shit together. Went to trade school. Didn&amp;#x27;t miss a single day, got my good grades for 2 years and when you finish you get an internship. I was a good boy and got an internship at what it seemed like a decent company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All ready to begin in april 2020 hehe. Covid hit and the internship got cancelled.

This summer, in fact. They just finished a final round of dilution a month ago, and the stock just hit a critical point where it’s actively in recovery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a real car, a product that *will* ship that nerds are geeking out about, and it appears now someone big is starting to slowly acquire it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first model will have its flaws, but it’s an electric car that can run off the solar panels on its roof. No one has ever done that before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the entire fucking company’s marketcap, this Nasdaq company, is $70 million. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’re welcome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Disclosure: I obviously own some moderate sized bags of this, as should you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902124&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go look the shit up on YouTube and do some research. Tech bros will buy out the first line of these as fun geek toys, and by the second and third iterations, it’s gonna start getting serious. The big boys (aka Tesla) cannot afford to let this company get too large under their toes. They’ll acquire the stock and buy them out before that happen. That’s my thesis, anyway. The company’s not perfect, it has issues. But it’s worth more than $70 million for damn sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902143&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;I believe that oil,nat gas, nuclear energy, clean coal is going to make a comeback, and that the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; stuff wont be &amp;quot; cool&amp;quot; anymore, I avoid betting on anyting &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;. At least I do not think the US will care about solar and wind turbines and all that crap anymore. In the Eu, that car would look ridicolous and nobody would drive it., btw in Eu we drive diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61902157&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902124&lt;br&gt;Almost had me interested before I saw that monstrosity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am about to dump $14k into this shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminder that this bot still hasn&amp;#x27;t said the nigger word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907267&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t do it anons...electric car companies are IDEAL for ponzi schemes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;faraday future&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nikola&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;atlis motor vehicles/nxu&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907858&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Price trickling up today….. someone big is absorbing the bid. They don’t want to run the price up, but if you have shares to offload they don’t mind absorbing them here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907869&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;not buying your bags OP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907929&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907869&lt;br&gt;That’s how I know there’s something here. Once /biz/ is euphoric about it, it’s time to get out. Gonna screenshot this and make fun of you in a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907984&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902124&lt;br&gt;It is cheap as dirt, but crazy new techie startups are a dime a dozen.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;we&amp;#x27;re just a bunch of geeks with a dream of building our own solar powered cars!&lt;br&gt;Yeah you and 1000 others. Unless the founders are somehow related to the CEO of Toyota or Ford or whatever, and they&amp;#x27;ll buy up the company, those guys will probably just up and die later and you&amp;#x27;ll never hear from them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kinda based. I would throw in a couple hundred bucks and forget about it, but there’s no way I’m putting real dough into this without some serious improvements. What’s the road map?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908115&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn now THIS is a chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908120&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907929&lt;br&gt;You responding to every criticism post is how I know you&amp;#x27;re just a desperate baggie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908205&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908115&lt;br&gt;Yeah they went public late last year and absolutely have ate shit since then, and did a round of dilution in January even to get this thing out the door. No one’s arguing that. I just think the stock has reached a buy point. If you check the price action the past month, the market agrees with me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907984&lt;br&gt;Bruh if one of the big boys wants to buy out this stock, that doesn’t bother me as a recent investor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908120&lt;br&gt;A baggie maybe, but not desperate. I just got into this a few days ago, so I’m actually up slightly. I’m just enjoying having a /biz/ where we can share ideas that aren’t the shitcoin du jour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908205&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;if one of the big boys wants to buy out this stock, that doesn’t bother me as a recent investor&lt;br&gt;No you moron, I&amp;#x27;m trying to say that in all likelihood that WON&amp;#x27;T happen. Because there&amp;#x27;s lots of startups and most don&amp;#x27;t have the capital or connections to make it through and break into success.&lt;br&gt;If you want people to invest in this particular stock then convince us that they&amp;#x27;re special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908330&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. the stock is down heavy.&lt;br&gt;2. OP is replying A LOT which is mega sus&lt;br&gt;3. it is rebounding a bit&lt;br&gt;4. OP is probably a fag baiting plebs into buying his bags (ie. selling calls, while dumping shares or selling puts and buying shares aka the gay price action)&lt;br&gt;5. i dont know what to do. that car is ugly as fuck. but even if they somehow match their next competitor MC that makes this an easy 100x&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908366&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907174&lt;br&gt;This was in peak &amp;quot;you vill eat ze bugs&amp;quot; era all the faggot companies like EV stocks, BYND, etc mooned in 2020. The EV market is far more refined now. No one is going to throw money at this just because it&amp;#x27;s an EV company like they were back then. Anything BYD puts out absolutely creams this garbage at like 1/5 the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902193&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902208&lt;br&gt;my goodness how much of this pile of shit are you holding Lol. Good luck friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908387&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;why would a bag holder shill on /biz/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;no one here has any money, nor can we collectively influence the market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908397&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;Kek /biz/ is back. It brings a tear to my eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the shill, its nice to see startups being pushed instead of shitcoins and boring ass crypto. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With that being said that thing looks like absolute garbage. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It reminds me a little of the ElectraMeccanica Solo a one seat electric car that was being hawked at the malls years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908498&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61902111&lt;br&gt;I got in before this thing was public&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I deserve everything)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908507&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908498&lt;br&gt;dude you&amp;#x27;re down 83%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908519&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908507&lt;br&gt;yeah...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been preordered since 2021 so I know how crazy this company is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this wasn&amp;#x27;t an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; play... the $5k bumped you up in queue for delivery and acts as a credit for when you actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908829&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61903586&lt;br&gt;Fuck all these faggots here. I&amp;#x27;m buying some just in spite of their seething. Thanks for sharing this company anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908843&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908829&lt;br&gt;The EV market is shrinking and you want to dump money into the gayest retard of the bunch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908849&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908829&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908843&lt;br&gt;two jeets arguing with each other&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908857&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908843&lt;br&gt;So what? I put a couple hundred bucks in and it crashes? Oh well, but if it gains traction than I turned my idle money into profit. I don&amp;#x27;t see anyone else here sharing any stocks or crypto. Just shit talking and gaslighting, So I&amp;#x27;m betting on the optimistic anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908863&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908849&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s a good one nigger, you got me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908519&lt;br&gt;Oh shit that’s awesome, an actual enthusiast. You must be a decently well off tech bro to pre-order something like that; I think that’ll be the first wave. The practical crowd will come later, but just imagine how cool an SUV model you can camp in will be - even if they have to cut some efficiency and it’ll need to be third gen or further. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And besides what these idiots are saying, a vehicle that can power itself by the literal sun is neat. I’m looking forward to the first retard who drives across the coast on solar power alone - though it’ll take a while. Anyway, thanks for chipping in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908857&lt;br&gt;That’s a good way to look at it because despite how neat the tech is, this company has real issues. But what startup company doesn’t. Still, I’m in for my money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909028&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908843&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;EV market is shrinking &lt;br&gt;Only in the US, and only in the US because the federal rebate went away, and companies such as Ford thought people actually wanted $140k electric pickup trucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909297&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;i&amp;#x27;m up almost 30% on my calls&lt;br&gt;cheers OP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909905&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61909297&lt;br&gt;Pure shares for me, thanks, though I recognize there’s probably some opportunity in the options as well - especially for something this low cap and illiquid. Cheers right back to you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>BUY EVERYTHING WITH CASH ONLY SAY NO TO DEBT SAY NO TO MORTGAGE — 28 replies — 20.7/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61905079</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61905079?lm=1772192193</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 11:36:33 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;BUY EVERYTHING WITH CASH ONLY SAY NO TO DEBT SAY NO TO MORTGAGE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61905079'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 28 • Updated: 2026-02-27 11:36 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUY EVERYTHING WITH CASH ONLY&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAY NO TO DEBT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAY NO TO MORTGAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905088&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;as a matter of fact DONT BUY ANYTHING&lt;br&gt;save EVERYTHING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905096&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;Based. If you have consumer debt you are absolutely and unequivocally poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905096&lt;br&gt;This. You bought latest iPhone?

Whenever I get a new credit card, I usually get a $200 bonus cash back, plus 0% APR for 12+ months.&lt;br&gt;Low/no interest debt is fucking awesome. You are a retard who sucks at math and long term planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905243&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;Have literally done all of this. Just on a smaller scale. My home and land are paid for(besides taxes), only 1 acre, manufactured home. I bought my truck 10 years ago cash, I still drive it every day. I have 1 credit card for &amp;quot;emergencies&amp;quot;, I dont have to work and I can smoke weed all day. I&amp;#x27;m as happy as I can imagine, but by any standard I&amp;#x27;m poor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905249&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;This guys advice seems to stem from assuming everyone is a nigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905253&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905232&lt;br&gt;did this for awhile, alot of banks and finance accounts offer the same rewards just for opening them. Some I never even used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905249&lt;br&gt;he was right for assuming boomers have a child&amp;#x27;s mindset because they did and still do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905395&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;Debitcard works too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61905446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nooooo think of the poor heckin bankers&lt;br&gt;lol. no, i don&amp;#x27;t think i will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907649&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905249&lt;br&gt;he&amp;#x27;s almost right&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907660&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUY MUTUAL FUNDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RICE AND BEANS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SELL THE KIDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BETTER THAN I DESERVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907724&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;Putting your entire stack as 20% down to get a mortgage is dumb. If your assets cover the mortgage, it&amp;#x27;s also not debt. Dave is in the business of engagement though...he thanks you for spreading his aura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907745&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907724&lt;br&gt;I like what he preaches. I finally started to respect every dollar. I was in a rough spot with payday loan now that I’m out of it I started saving. He hates payday lenders so do I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907808&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;retarded boomer gives incredibly dumb financial advice to other retarded boomers who somehow managed to be poor despite working in the single most prosperous time period in the history of the fucking world&lt;br&gt;Imagine being able to buy between 1 and 2 oz of .999 gold just by flipping burgers at McDonalds for a week. How did any of those faggots manage to fuck up their lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907901&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905232&lt;br&gt;This wasn&amp;#x27;t the own you thought it was lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CASH ONLY&lt;br&gt;you mean your worthless papers that are spawned into existence through usury itself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nah thanks, I&amp;#x27;ll just keep making thousands churning credit cards. never once carried a balance or paid interest cause im not a retarded nigger. later boomer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908034&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905088&lt;br&gt;How much debt you in bud? Don&amp;#x27;t be mad at Dave cuz he&amp;#x27;s old school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908045&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905232&lt;br&gt;No one ever got rich from credit card perks. I&amp;#x27;m not arguing that interest-free debt is cool but don&amp;#x27;t act like credit cards are how you get wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908654&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;Horrible advice. Buy with credit cards that offer rewards, then pay them off in full every month before due date. Im up to 40 dols in cashback rewards just using cards instead of my debit, then paying off the bill with money I was going to use to buy the stuff in the first place. Literal free money and my credit score has been soaring. Fuck wish id done this a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908821&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;People meme on Dave a lot but I don&amp;#x27;t think he&amp;#x27;s that bad, I just don&amp;#x27;t think Dave is really meant for people who can control their spending. If you even somewhat understand money and you have a healthy savings account, good 401k, and don&amp;#x27;t have a ton of debt you aren&amp;#x27;t his target audience. His target audience is people who -&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;are 21-50 years old&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have a $1.5k a month car loan for 84 months &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;buy Labubus and other weird shit&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can&amp;#x27;t control their spending&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have 5 credit cards&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have no savings or long term investments&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;make $15 an hour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908832&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908654&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s the thing though, these people CANNOT control their spending. That&amp;#x27;s why giving them credit cards is a bad idea and why he says not to get them. If you know how you use a credit card IE just use it like a debit card, don&amp;#x27;t finance expensive shit or max it out, then you&amp;#x27;re fine. You gotta remember the people who need his advice probably have like sub 600 credit and ridiculous interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908860&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908832&lt;br&gt;Yea. Ive come to understand as I get older peoples choices are the prime factor in their situation and bad luck is just a cope they console themselves with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61908878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908821&lt;br&gt;This anon gets it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909951&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61908821&lt;br&gt;his videos have like millions of views, I wonder if theres that many people who are bad with finances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909964&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905079&lt;br&gt;shit i realized when i was sixteen for 500, Alex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61909987&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907808&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s always a cheap asset that&amp;#x27;s an &amp;quot;obvious buy&amp;quot; looking back, no one can predict the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy platinum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61910179&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;shit, my earning didn&amp;#x27;t outpace inflation.

It&amp;#x27;s going to be 1973 oil crisis 2.0. &lt;br&gt;Somebody somewhere will bomb some oil terminals, or block some canal. &lt;br&gt;As a , oil prices will temporarily go up to $100-150 . &lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think this will be bad for US at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%931975_recession&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906303&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906215&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906276&lt;br&gt;retarded newfags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906318&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906303&lt;br&gt;Your point is that there&amp;#x27;s nowhere to go but up? &lt;br&gt;Did US government hold BTC during previous cycles, or not really? &lt;br&gt;Do they own any BTC now? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in billions of $ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;retarded newfags are hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906325&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906318&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;muh Saylor&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;muh US government&lt;br&gt;none of this shit matters, people said the same thing in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906340&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61905957&lt;br&gt;I sold mine at $68, hoping to buy back at $38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906342&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906325&lt;br&gt;US gov holds BTC in BILLIONS of $ directly. &lt;br&gt;Taken from various mafia and criminals. &lt;br&gt;BTC is the 3rd largest holding of US gov after gold .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do your REALLY think that US gov that has $38 TRILLION in boomer debt, &lt;br&gt;going to let their largest asset holdings to significantly go down?&lt;br&gt;Are you retarded? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or are they secretly accumulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906343&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906299&lt;br&gt;yea, long term. but the immediate response to prices will obviously be a 30% giga nuke and its happening SOOON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906976&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;no US recession --&amp;gt; 43k by September 2026&lt;br&gt;US recession --&amp;gt; 27k by March 2027&lt;br&gt;GFC 2.0 --&amp;gt; 12k by July 2027&lt;br&gt;Great Depression 2.0 --&amp;gt; close to 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61906994&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906303&lt;br&gt;when priced in gold, we hit our ATH in 230 days in or so. &lt;br&gt;Bear market is done starting this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907085&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61906343&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; SP500 dipped 6% in 2024 after Iran sent drones to Israel&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; SP500 dipped 4% in 2025 after they bombed Iran with B2s and Iran fired rockets into Israel&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s almost like your middle east shithole news have no impact on the economy. &lt;br&gt;Goycattle like yourself have no say how this nothingburger will affect the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61907096&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61907085&lt;br&gt;that happened during a bull market so yeah obviously bearish news had no effect.

Momentum is decreasing since Sep 2023. For the span of 2012 and 2020-2022 home sales prices increased so euphorically it put us at 2007 levels of momentum &amp;amp; momentum change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens next? Between 4-10 years, coincidently aligned with the beginning window of mass boomer die-off, prices and rates will crash to a new generational low. They WONT lower prices and there WONT be buyers. There will clearly be a socially uncomfortable liquidity crisis spanning 15-20 years until they&amp;#x27;re all dead. Look to buy in 2030ish at the earliest. But you are likely to get a much better deal in 2035-2040.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of this needed to happen if boomers didn&amp;#x27;t pump their worthless hooms during the fake manufactured virus scare.
