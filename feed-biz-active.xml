Nobody will ever love them and I can also make 10 million without displaying my butthole for the world to see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889278&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s only like top1% creators making millions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889279&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;i didnt care too for so long but now im starting to care fml its just so unfair.. Not only are they extremely hot they also get to make 20MM a year for years scamming with bikini pics on OF&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its just so unfair i feel like crying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889409&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an enormous amount of work too when you get big enough to make decent cash but not enough to sustain yourself. Answering 48 messages in the morning yourself because you can&amp;#x27;t afford to pay a guy to do it for and you can&amp;#x27;t not answer because these guys are shelling out 70 percent of your revenue. Then you return. Film more. Do it again and scrape by for maybe 900 bucks a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s almost more worth it to end up being worth a few cheeseburgers so you know you aren&amp;#x27;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889624&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you really cared you would be pimping OF models by now. You think women do anything in their own? They all have pimps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not glamorous but you can go on craigslist whenever you want and make a quick couple hundred getting your dick sucked by lonely old queers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889644&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889631&lt;br&gt;How is that even worth $200? Enjoy your money pox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889769&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;Holy cope. Obviously most men will love them because men are horny dogs. Its 2026, prime time to realize men are the more pathetic gender. This aint the 50s champ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889773&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nobody will ever love them&lt;br&gt;These bitches get BFs all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889775&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;how do you guys cope with the fact that OF egirls are making tens of millions a year?&lt;br&gt;Only the top 1% do, the rest make around few hundred USD or few 20-40USD a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889273&lt;br&gt;Lot of them have BFs and lot of them don&amp;#x27;t do porn with other men just sell their nudes but most aren&amp;#x27;t making enough to retire on not by a longshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889777&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;1. They don&amp;#x27;t receive all that money, they are hired under an umbrella corporation, they are just models for hire.&lt;br&gt;2. They are women, they don&amp;#x27;t know how to invest their money (see amouranth, it was her husband who put her in front of the camera, managed her socials and invested her money)&lt;br&gt;3. I can&amp;#x27;t see what you would do with that much money, unless you are hyper-dependent on people doing things for you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;They aren&amp;#x27;t. The vast majority have sold their souls for triple digit profits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889830&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparing yourself to women is one of the first steps on the tranny pipeline lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889840&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Go sell your asshole to strangers and lookmax then you lazy cunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889979&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Nothings stopping you from doing gya shit on onlyfans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Doesn&amp;#x27;t bother me in the least.&lt;br&gt;Firstly, it causes tons of women to throw their lives away being whores. So is hardly a victory for women.&lt;br&gt;Secondly, what does that money do other than ruin their lives? Women crave a man higher on the totem pole than they are, now they can&amp;#x27;t find one for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892313&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;I make faceless straight gay porn. I just ride a bunch of dildos pretending its my first time and they get to pretend they are the ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gigs not bad pays about 5k a month. My wife is my manager and hells clean my dildos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its not pleasurable by any means just feels like a fat shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892313&lt;br&gt;lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893140&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889830&lt;br&gt;everyone compares themselves to women, they are people too after all not some different species&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start an only fans account.&lt;br&gt;Show the world your talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My a PBJ using your dick to spread the stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Profit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t give up until you try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893392&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make a PBJ!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893415&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889279&lt;br&gt;nigga are you stupid, hot girls have always had ez mode, any girl with looks + little brains can hustle money like crazy. I knew a waitress 2 years ago working in a shitty diner that was finessing 3-4 boomers, I remember one time a boomer literally handed her a $3,000 check, no sexual favors or anything, just sweet talk, this chick was spending 5-10,000 dollars a month on clothes and was driving a brand new Jeep luxury model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893458&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;I know a money laundering scheme when I see one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893483&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892313&lt;br&gt;Fucking kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893517&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;At least i can coom out of the leaked photos of these e-prostitutes, i can&amp;#x27;t cope with the fact some teenage faggot like barron trump (or Eric i don&amp;#x27;t know who&amp;#x27;s is who in that family of pagan gods worshiper faggots) make billions just because he was born in the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893555&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have never paid for porn or whores in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893557&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;the same way I cope with dude getting paid millions to play with balls, I don&amp;#x27;t care. it&amp;#x27;s not me and it doesn&amp;#x27;t impact me, so why should I give a shit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;99% of them are making like 20 bucks a month lmfao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893631&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889354&lt;br&gt;I met a girl who was a friend of a friend of mine at a party when I was younger and she literally handed me a business card with her OF address on it. I didn&amp;#x27;t realize what it was at first but the second I read it I blurted out &amp;quot;What the fuck is wrong with you?&amp;quot; without thinking and she got super offended. I&amp;#x27;m pretty sure I was the first person she handed it to that actually said anything negative about it by the way she reacted, which is very bizarre to me. It&amp;#x27;s kind of crazy how common this shit is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893680&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889270&lt;br&gt;Like everything in the world of money being born a woman was a gamble&lt;br&gt;You just lost it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think about women at all anon. They are the worst investment you can make in life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893708&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889282&lt;br&gt;this right here. tons of people play sports, statistically, 0.000001 get paid well. Image stretching you butthole for a year or two and then finally coming to the conclusion it would have been both easier and more profitable to work a mcjob. add in its a clear red flag so they wont ever get a quality man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893748&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893140&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t. tranny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Link vs XRP — 43 replies — 172.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889600</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889600?lm=1771893745</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:42:25 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Link vs XRP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889600'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 43 • Updated: 2026-02-24 00:42 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will the gap close? Link came within a hair of flipping xrp in January ‘21. We all know that Link is everything Xrp fraudulently claims to be so it makes sense that this chart should flip soon enough. Will it be gradual or violent? Will it flip because xrp crashes or because Link moons? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly where are some places you can use Link as collateral to borrow Xrp to take full advantage of the trade of the century?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889606&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m so tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889622&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;Link is scam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy XRP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890519&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889823&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889827&lt;br&gt;Oh hey I remember this deranged plebbit shitbag peddling cripple marketing material unironically&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;if you make fun of me or my fat jew goblin xrp shitcoin youre a LITERAL &amp;quot;pharisee&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;youre LITERALLY &amp;quot;abstracting&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;mirroring&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;xrp is LITERALLY a force of objective good guys, for real&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;xrp is gonna LITERALLY save the banks FROM usury &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I LITERALLY have no idea how swift fees work on a basic level and all of my hopium relies on my failure to comprehend this&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;muh LITERAL saudi prince&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890539&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biepum is in this very thread, seething at the standard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All and every progress regarding the &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;flippening&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; that they have been praying for can be found here&lt;br&gt;https://link-flip.alwaysbeshipp.ing/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RLUSD will sooner overtake chainlinks mcap than chainlink xrp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;It will be violent, and partly due to xrp crashing, but in no small part due to link pumping. Its going to happen after Clarity act + full staking release and neet nodes. So 2050 at this rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890840&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890828&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;dude, le clarity&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;le full staking&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;le neet nodes&lt;br&gt;never happening, sweetie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890870&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889606&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889622&lt;br&gt;the only usecase any of these has is XLM; because africans are still trading phone minutes as currency and XLM is a reasonable replacement&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XRP and LINK are complete LARPs that nobody even trusts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and i don&amp;#x27;t even give a shit about giving africans currency. but its literally the only thing your larp does in the physical world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890891&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890390&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;common enterprise&lt;br&gt;You bought a product, not a share. Everything you just wrote proves this is a speculation and not an investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889827&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;https://ripple.com/insights/institutional-defi-on-xrpl-scaling-real-world-finance-with-xrp-at-the-core/&lt;br&gt;You keep posting same article like its some kind of mic drop moment. As if linking it over and over suddenly turns it into undeniable proof. It doesn’t lol Youre taking a CEOs words at face value because you think hes personally invested in making you rich. Thats not how this works. CEOs promote their companies and his job is to literally sell you XRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891035&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;Thanks spammy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889620&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891011&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not. It is literally the products they are building and the material they are releasing detailing it to shareholders. Link sell directly to retail every time there is a minor pump. You are literally saying nothing but standing in a way where you think if you come across as affirmative in a direct way it will seem like you are. Lol You are just doing what you accuse me of (which I am not) saying we can&amp;#x27;t trust it to be true because it is relying on the words of someone. It literally isn&amp;#x27;t. They are structuring XRPL core amendment pushes and having their staff code them based on the product suite fit detailed in the article. They made multiple multibillion dollar acquisitions, including a fucking prime broker to actuate it all. And most importantly, the majority of their treasury is in XRP and their products are ALL made more efficient and cost efficient using it and they are incentivized to increase the price of XRP they have in escrow and cannot sell, unlike CLL who dump what was supposed to be operator rewards on retail always and are LITERALLY a fraud designed to milk your savings (exactly what you project Ripple to be, which it isn&amp;#x27;t because the XRPL actually solves efficiencies instead of sticking a tollbooth in the middle of process for literally no reason like a jewish parasite). The entire XRPL is designed to automatically use XRP for auto-bridging between assets etc. Your argument sucks and it is hilarious that it actually applies to link, which you are capable of seeing but literally don&amp;#x27;t care because you are in a literal cult pretending to object but just obsessively committed to a project that is the least morally redeemable or utility having one in all of crypto for literally no reason than ego and entrenched specific coin cultism. Really odd and gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890083&lt;br&gt;Extreme cope. SWIFT said it would take 15 years MINIMUM to even get a product active. I am not sorry to let you know that by that time SWIFT will have 100% missed the boat and payments will have been completely revolutionized, not needing them. You hitched your dingy to a big ship, but it turned out it was the Titanic, which we all always said. Way too little way too late presuming the ethgate lawfare would win but it didn&amp;#x27;t. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890250&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;MPT/permissioned dex is the standard&lt;br&gt;No it hasn&amp;#x27;t. You literally don&amp;#x27;t know what either of those things are. No other ledger at scale has a built in dex and amm and protocol layer compliance like permissioned dex nor the broadness of the MPT standard. It definitely has been The Standard, but not in the way you think. MPT is not &amp;quot;wrapped assets.&amp;quot; Here is an AI slop video that is actually informative which possibly someone at your level of research will be able to be spoonfed by:&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/3kYXW_o-N4Y&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890519&lt;br&gt;Top cope in thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890891&lt;br&gt;Everything written proves it&amp;#x27;s a security anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890307&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890390&lt;br&gt;The only thing that needs to happen to settle the debate is someone suing. And given chainlink seemingly gives zero fucks about it&amp;#x27;s holders it&amp;#x27;s probably long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891887&lt;br&gt;It has an etf already bro it’s a defacto commodity and will soon be enshrined in law as a commodity. Also may I just congratulate you on your point that ripple is incentivised to increase the price of Xrp since that is most of their treasury, unlike CLL who also has most of their treasury in Link but is not incentivised to increase the price. I thought that was most salient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892122&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;Dunno man, but the best times with link have been when I forgot about it during the bear and came back to big gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892185&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891717&lt;br&gt;So other than the CEOs word, what proof do you have they&amp;#x27;re integrating XRP into everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892337&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892108&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CLL who also has most of their treasury in Link but is not incentivised to increase the price.&lt;br&gt;And they never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892414&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891011&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youre taking a CEOs words at face value because you think hes personally invested in making you rich.

And given chainlink seemingly gives zero fucks about it&amp;#x27;s holders it&amp;#x27;s probably long overdue.&lt;br&gt;/thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892185&lt;br&gt;I already mentioned it you fucking retard. You can see the ledger amendment history that they have spent their own dev money and time developing, their acquisitions of Hidden Road, etc. their getting binance listing RLUSD on the XRPL, the fact the early team specifically coded the ledger to explicitly default to its use and to save several percentage points over Ripplenet alone by doing so, the fact that they locked the vast bulk of their corporate treasury up in timed release in it, the fact they fund and partner with multiple large banks to drive and encourage its use and adoption, and the fact the services they are building out literally optimize using it and offer counterparty-less feature that no other asset onchain can, and the fact that they already use it in their business. They literally legally can&amp;#x27;t use it in most contexts yet but with clarity their business can become much more efficient and as a result their core holding increases in value. There is LITERALLY no reason to argue they are not building for its use other than being butthurt that it is true and trying to repress reality like a faggot. They literally have Fednow service providers running XRPL nodes and big banks who are their largest outside investors issuing bonds that reward in XRP (who were celebrated recently in their specific crypto efforts by the financial regulator of Japan) and are partnering with DBS (biggest bank in Singapore (Switzerland of Asia) and Franklin Templeton (trillion plus dollars AUM) building out a repo market on the XRPL. They got ONDO issuing on the XRPL, one of the largest asset managers in Europe/England doing same while basically no one is getting headway in England, Societe General (one of biggest banks in Europe) expanding to include XRP for their euro stablecoin which can bridge to RLUSD using XRP, etc. Literally everything they do builds around corporately driving XRP&amp;#x27;s adoption, literally just fleshing out a business sweet around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892679&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892659&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892185&lt;br&gt;This isn&amp;#x27;t even 10% of what could be said partnership etc. wise. XRP and link are different in that XRP actually improves business performance and has a reason to exist and incentivizes use in products. Link is literally just a toll booth jew token to insert costs where they would not technologically exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892108&lt;br&gt;The difference is CLL dumps on retail all the time and their business is not improved by the operation of link, it is a technologically pointless token, literally. Ripple hasn&amp;#x27;t sold publicly in over 5 years to retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892697&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889600&lt;br&gt;It will most likely be extremely violent the likes of which has literally never been seen before. I am very excited for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892933&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891755&lt;br&gt;you&amp;#x27;re practically crying, and they did not say that. I&amp;#x27;m sorry you bet on the wrong horse backed by criminals. to think swift is going to lose is unbelievable amounts of stupidity. haha why am i even talking to you, cya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892973&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893028&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;br&gt;I mean you&amp;#x27;re retarded and wrong but the cripplets are retarded and right. If that helps at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Idk if you link cucks have ever visited the /XSG/ threads but they are hardly ever discussing &amp;quot;muh utility&amp;quot; or even acknowledging other crypto. I&amp;#x27;m pretty sure they&amp;#x27;re currently going /X/ mode and trying to get a retard to be a sacrifice volunteer Mayan style to pump xrp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is hilarious. Anyway buy silver crypto fags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893103&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892933&lt;br&gt;Really pathetic cope and projection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893028&lt;br&gt;Will it work though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893669&lt;br&gt;I meaann... it works for the jews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I MADE IT — 26 replies — 104.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893164</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893164?lm=1771893799</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:43:19 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;I MADE IT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893164'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 26 • Updated: 2026-02-24 00:43 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;dumped 5 figures into silver at $72&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;found my soulmate and she’s madly in love with me &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;she lurks on /pol/&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;she’s a sexy french/scottish/italian/irish unvaxxed skinny flat earth schizo racist nazi who wants to be a stay at home mother and revoke women’s rights&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;my job pays really well and lets me play video games most of the time and is immune to the AI takeover due to its nature&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realized I don’t need to be super rich to “make it”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893172&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893164&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;my job pays really well and lets me play video games most of the time and is immune to the AI takeover due to its nature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893186&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893172&lt;br&gt;they don’t know I play vidya all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893194&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893164&lt;br&gt;I have also made it, but the girl I&amp;#x27;m with is about 5 days from the wall.

The unicorns don&amp;#x27;t care about money. I&amp;#x27;ve brought my wife along with me out of poverty and all she does is bitch about how I drink too much. I could be the first trillionaire, give her half, and she&amp;#x27;d still just want to get me sober so I don&amp;#x27;t die first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893565&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893164&lt;br&gt;Good job anon.

When you make a real connection with the opposite sex your mate is always sexy. Look at bezos, his plastic fake ass bitch brings up the bile from the back of my neck, but he&amp;#x27;ll probably keep loving her as her face continues to melt off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893589&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893574&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a lot of cope for someone who is fucking someone i would have thought is a male had I not been explicitly told it&amp;#x27;s female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893594&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893524&lt;br&gt;grim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893609&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893574&lt;br&gt;Just say it&amp;#x27;s the first 3/10 that ever agreed to touch you and all will be fine, but don&amp;#x27;t lie to us by calling her sexy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893615&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893164&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;my job pays really well and lets me play video games most of the time&lt;br&gt;you&amp;#x27;re gonna lose that girl asap rocky at that rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893164&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;she lurks on /pol/&lt;br&gt;Ew.

He&amp;#x27;s a media player and if you actually listened to some of his shit there does seem to be an interesting intersection between blockchain capabilities and homeownership etc...not financial advice of course just a variety of things I was peeking at when researching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879999&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879836&lt;br&gt;What is your current occupation anon? Nothing revealing but in general etc...the exercise price of the warrants is $15...trading currently at less than a dollar it seems like a confusing deal...at this point if one likes the company wouldn&amp;#x27;t shares be the move? I did some modeling around warrant prices if the shares price goes to xyz and that is very interesting...also speaking of interesting what&amp;#x27;s the deal with the alleged cusip similarity to the old bbbyq shares?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880091&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879999&lt;br&gt;Financial system. I am not asking you to hold those warrants until they are exercised. I am asking you to hold them and sell the warrants when we can realize a substantial profit. Nice quads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880091&lt;br&gt;Interesting. Wouldn&amp;#x27;t trading the warrants implicitly come with a short term capital gains tax insofar as its impossible to hold them over a year at this point? Would have to be some pretty fair gains to offset that 40% hit...anyways doesn&amp;#x27;t the warrants increasing in price also imply that the shares have gone up in price as well? I ran some informal modeling estimates using black scholes with iv, roughly .65 years to expiry and this is what I came up with: 15.5 bbby share price = 4.50ish warrant price...25 share price/12ish warrant price...60 share price/45ish warrant price...100 share price/85ish warrant price...200 share price 185ish warrant price...I make no claim as to the veracity of these numbers, just for fun. Anyways what do you see happening to the bbby stock price for these warrants to be worthwhile? Am I thinking on the right track in general?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881670&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881753&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879999&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881477&lt;br&gt;note the digis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881916&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;Buy these if you want, but remember, these warrants are not related to the canceled BBBYQ/DK-Butterfly, reguardless of what the BBBYQ schizos say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881980&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881916&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nobody tell him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882152&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;I hold a few&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882389&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;why are americans starting to invest more into VT?&lt;br&gt;isn&amp;#x27;t america the greatest country on earth?&lt;br&gt;for me it has always been VOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;look at NPC holder distribution&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;there&amp;#x27;s no big dumps&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;base still present&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;conviction quietly intact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884950&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880091&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re allowed to buy warrants, won&amp;#x27;t your employer know you bought them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885366&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get ready everyone.

You&amp;#x27;re right, sometimes you do everything right and shit sucks anyways. That&amp;#x27;s what the book of Job is about. You still need to keep the faith, like he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889098&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61887380&lt;br&gt;BBBYW is more like a lifeboat for people who missed BBBYQ. If you held a fat stack (10,000 plus) of BBBYQ into cancellation then you are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890133&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889098&lt;br&gt;2,000 sh @ 038&lt;br&gt;I dont care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892966&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one is ever getting shit for canceled BBBYQ shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893640&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882152&lt;br&gt;Every asset I own was red today&lt;br&gt;Besides my BBBY warrants&lt;br&gt;Thank you anon schizos for saving my portfolio a month ago with this knowledge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Financial independence / retire early — 41 replies — 58.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61884958</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61884958?lm=1771891928</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:12:08 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Financial independence / retire early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61884958'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 41 • Updated: 2026-02-24 00:12 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How&amp;#x27;s FIRE going for you, anons?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884964&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884958&lt;br&gt;Well I&amp;#x27;m looking into LCOL countries I can retire to because waiting until I&amp;#x27;m a multi millionaire in the states is not viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884966&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884958&lt;br&gt;Just need a 7x then I&amp;#x27;m good.

Under IRC §4975 you are considered a &amp;quot;disqualified&amp;quot; person. Basically you can own it but you can never touch it. Very gay way to &amp;#x27;own&amp;#x27; something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885054&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;way ahead of schedule.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Full time job income (104K + 11K in retirement)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Cost of living 32K&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Fully owned apartment(450K)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;308K in liquidish assets&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;90K in retirement&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;2K coming in every month from passive revenue from a side business (vidya gaems)&lt;br&gt;In 7-8 years i will probably reach full FIRE. But i&amp;#x27;m releasing new products this year. If i can have similar success i will probably just Barista FIRE living the gamedev dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885059&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884967&lt;br&gt;Dude, just quit. You&amp;#x27;ll probably decompress after a month or two, then you can re-evaluate. If you decide you need to work, then you can just go apply to some jobs. Maybe you&amp;#x27;ll decide you want to work in a library or something stupid like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885062&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885030&lt;br&gt;that fucking sucks what is Cardone talking about then?&lt;br&gt;retirement money is just going to the bank then when I starve to death. maybe that was their plan all along. &lt;br&gt;take the 10% penalty + taxes ? now it&amp;#x27;s a duplex maybe in a cold flyover state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885102&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just had my 2nd kid.&lt;br&gt;Already gave up and accepted that I&amp;#x27;ll be waging til I die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885131&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884958&lt;br&gt;Pretty good despite the recent market drawdown. I stopped working 9 months ago and moved to a luxury condo in Thailand. Expenses are relatively low but I&amp;#x27;m still paying my mortgage and car note in America. I get a little bit of income from trading options and renting out my house to my younger sister. I&amp;#x27;m financially set for the rest of my life but I&amp;#x27;m still figuring out what I want to do as far as family, kids, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885135&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885062&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885030&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884986&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ok I found this. instead of self directed IRA to have to roll it into a business startup&lt;br&gt;so don&amp;#x27;t an hero yet &lt;br&gt;or put me down as your beneficiary first&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;https://www.bankrate.com/loans/small-business/what-are-robs/#:~:text=Key%20takeaways,penalties%20are%20associated%20with%20ROBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885141&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884967&lt;br&gt;Nigger. Based on the 4% rule you can draw about 120k yearly off investments and statistically never run out of money. Wife and I retired early w/ Lite Fire. No debt. Last year our gross income was $55,000. We bought and sold a RV, Saw the Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Rushmore. Took a 21 day cruise from west coast through Panama Canal, Cruised out of Florida for 3 weeks and hung out in Fort Lauderdale for 2. Did 2 more week in the Caribbean. Have a 20 day transatlantic cruise from NYC to Sicily booked with stops in 9 ports in April. Tons of midweek short trips seeing cool shit. Leaving work is an adjustment definitely but I have never been happier. See the world, meet people, always with an eye to relocation. Picrel is heading into Cartagena Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885152&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884967&lt;br&gt;I was just like you before I decided to walk away. I call it &amp;quot;golden handcuffs&amp;quot; when a job pays so well that it makes you feel obligated to keep going even though you don&amp;#x27;t need the money. Your job feels like your identity but I promise you&amp;#x27;ll forget about it after you quit and find new hobbies and a gf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887260&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884974&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884996&lt;br&gt;Japan is not a lcol area. Its cheaper compared to the west but not Thailand/Vietnam cheap. My plan is to live 90 days visa free there a year and live frugally elsewhere for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887270&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884958&lt;br&gt;Closing in on luxury fat FIRE thanks to gold/silver/oil/uranium. Fuck crypto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887292&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t want to retire early, cuz id probably just be doing the same thing without getting paid for it, but i have enough money to be comfortable for now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887302&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am starting to realize the whole game plan of FIRE is just giving me reason to wake up in the morning, something to look forward to. I dont think I will really be that much happier once I achieve my dream of semi financial freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887313&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61887292&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;id probably just be doing the same thing without getting paid for it&lt;br&gt;Your job is your hobby? Congrats. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887338&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not really going.&lt;br&gt;Would take me getting my inheritance and buying the bottom of the next global market crash and riding the recovery wave with everything I can throw in during it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887601&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;uhh im 38. been retired since 32. probably unretiring soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887625&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61887313&lt;br&gt;gay prostitute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890044&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61887302&lt;br&gt;frugality is like a game, to see how little i can spend each month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885054&lt;br&gt;what&amp;#x27;s your side business anon? reseller?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890085&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;is 1.5M too little to retire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I round tripped 8 figs being greedy&lt;br&gt;its all i have left&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61890085&lt;br&gt;depends where you live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890151&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885102&lt;br&gt;My #2 is 4 months old now. Thanks to the fire-induced frugality I was able to reduce my hours for half a year by 10 hours a week which was priceless in itself. Will probably also wage forever but probably only 20 hours or so per week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884958&lt;br&gt;We managed to pay off the house @32. other than that I only have 15k cash and 50k in the MSCI. &lt;br&gt;The plan was to retire @40 but unrealistic unless I win the lottery ( and I don&amp;#x27;t even play)&lt;br&gt;So yes full fire is impossible right now, but on the plus side: we need less than 2k/ month for a very comfortable life. &lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m converting a part of the house to a rental flat atm which should bring another 600 per month and allow for tax deductions.&lt;br&gt;After installing solar this year my electricity bill should drop from 110 to 40 per month. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So all in all we can have a cozy lifestyle for an acceptable trade off in lifetime. &lt;br&gt;Wife would like to work 20 hours/week in 10 years or so, I should be able to fully switch to do freelance consultant work in my niche ( or not. Her meager wage combined with the surplus of the next 10 years should easily pay for everything and give the kids a nice tailwind) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m putting 180 bucks/month per kind into an ETF which should become a nice 150k downpayment (infl.adj.) when they turn 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890181&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never gonna happen on my income. Millennials are fucked out of retirement. At least I own all my shit and have actual children and a loyal wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890213&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont know what number to stop at..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891226&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884968&lt;br&gt;Balkan and Baltic countries are cheap and super white. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck off if you&amp;#x27;re not white though. They&amp;#x27;re the most racist countries and that&amp;#x27;s what makes them awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891591&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885054&lt;br&gt;What games?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892297&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884958&lt;br&gt;Currently putting about 50-60% of my net income into my mortgage. I&amp;#x27;ll have the ($200k) house paid off in April/May next year, and then I&amp;#x27;ll be close enough to financially independent to relax a bit. I also have about $180k in an index fund.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m low maintenance so I can live on $10-15k a year after that, so I don&amp;#x27;t need a real job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892307&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m not sure if it will be achievable since AI will replace most white collar jobs. I’ll be happy if I can just get coast FIRE. I thought that there might be another ten years of white collar work, but I’ve narrowed the timeline with these new models. Claude Code and Cowork are too promising. I just don’t think that there will be too many jobs by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893606&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884967&lt;br&gt;Buy and learn to ride motorcycles.

LLMs are useful for some things but the notion that they are going to anything other than a glorified search engine needs to die. Yeah they are good a being a search engine, search engines are useful, but they suffer from the same problems as search engines, namely that a internet search can never actually tell you if the information it find is accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research needs to look an entirely different direction if they want true intelligence. We&amp;#x27;ve been working on text generators for decades so it shouldn&amp;#x27;t be surprising that we&amp;#x27;ve managed to perfect them, but the next breakthrough is going to come from something else we&amp;#x27;ve been working on for decades, not from incremental improvements to LLMs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who knows, maybe LLMs can aid in the research of this alternative field which will bring the next advancement? Using better technology to do research can cut down the years required so the accelerated nature of technology remains, but it is still going to come from somewhere people aren&amp;#x27;t expecting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LLMs can still be useful, but the costs associated with it are going to become prohibitive. Eventually they are going to just be like railways or telecoms which serve as an expensive base over which the next thing can emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893571&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;AGI is here as of two months ago, it&amp;#x27;s openclaw when using anything smarter than Opus 4.5. Companies are beginning to hire mac minis instead of people. If you still want to meme about r&amp;#x27;s in strawberry and pretend this isn&amp;#x27;t happening, that&amp;#x27;s at your own risk. You&amp;#x27;ll be out of a job sooner rather than later.

Just lift the skirt and blast the pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883784&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884737&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Without HR you could complete the work, banter and build a genuine camaraderie with your common co-worker, but we cant have unions, and its better if you&amp;#x27;re all divided and conquered, here&amp;#x27;s a harpy to make your life hell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884742&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873193&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872087&lt;br&gt;These niggers actually get it. All problems flow downstream from jews controlling the issuance of your (since 1913) fake and gay fiat debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885902&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;You must be over 18 to use this site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886326&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882442&lt;br&gt;Yeah this kind of mega über schizos who believe in fe and no nuke use this phrase holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882442&lt;br&gt;And yes the idea of space is falsifiable you absolute schizo. Satellites wouldn&amp;#x27;t even work without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883784&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Such a weird term clearly carrying different meaning. What is the point of using a term that literally has no definition to its meaning&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s just people overusing words or ideas to oblivion, where they lose all context. It&amp;#x27;s like the worst insult was being called gay way back, then it was subverted (actually gay is cool), then it became retarded, then it got subverted (actually retarded is cool because you&amp;#x27;re not trying), then it become autistic, then it became subverted (actually it&amp;#x27;s interesting to be autistic), now it&amp;#x27;s random baby talk by gen alpha (mog, cortisol spike, chopped, unc, lil bro, frame, aura farming, 67, incel, cuk). Now it&amp;#x27;s being subverted by people overusing the terms even if they don&amp;#x27;t apply to anyone or anything in the context at all. Someone not having sex for a week = incel. Someone having a slightly embarrassing moment (cortisol spike), someone better looking walking past (mogged), doing something that&amp;#x27;s barely good (aura farming), having a strong presence even if it&amp;#x27;s completely autistic and retarded (frame). Or like when old people started wearing skateboard shirts having no clue what it was, or everyone and their dog wearing an off white shirt. People make shit gay eventually, it&amp;#x27;s a universal law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886363&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;work office job (engineer) with way too many women and diversity hire niggers and Indians who do nothing all day&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;get new (white) South African Vice President&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;calls us all together&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in his funny accent tells us he’s an engineer and knows the business and there will be changes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tells us he will cut 20% of the workforce soon&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;everyone is shit scared and the normie femoids start climbing over each other trying to save their useless asses&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;office girlies start spreading rumours about everyone and everything in desperate attempt to make themselves look better&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;don’t give a fuck, I’m a technician and actually make money for the company unlike them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Vice President just observes the shit show and never comments on anything while he feels out the office&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;come in one Monday&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;literally all blacks are gone&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all except the actual useful Indians are gone&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he culled every single female that we all knew had jewish make believe adult daycare jobs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;only kept the old hag secretaries that actually do a great job&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kek, based white nigger. Turns out all it takes is some third world coloniser to clean this woke shit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886555&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;We are not capitalist.&lt;br&gt;We have been Trotskyist since the end of WW2.&lt;br&gt;Having a central bank is plank #5 of the commie manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886576&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884742&lt;br&gt;It was a bit delayed until after 1913.&lt;br&gt;They couldn’t go full fakeconomy immediately, or they would have been shut down.&lt;br&gt;They had to wait and boil the frog slowly, using the occasional crisis as a speed boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t ever interact with HR once I&amp;#x27;m hired until I&amp;#x27;m inevitably fired. From where comes the HR hate? Are they the ones who actually make the decisions to fire us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886684&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;this board is dead as shit holy fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886687&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886684&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the weekend. It picks up when the market is open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886692&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;d fuck all of them. At the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886363&lt;br&gt;Sounds illegal and fake. This is such an obvious thing to do, there must be a reason it doesn&amp;#x27;t actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889346&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not going to collapse... bill gates will grow some cheap bug burgers and psyop all the women to think it&amp;#x27;s healthy and great for the environment... so we can continue feeding billions of women to do nothing but work in an office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889382&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886363&lt;br&gt;How was he able to be able to gauge who&amp;#x27;s useful and who&amp;#x27;s not in such a short period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889387&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889346&lt;br&gt;Also, paying women to do nothing is one of the best birth controls there is. They are incapable of dating down. Sorry, just the messenger. bullshit jobs, especially for women, will never end until picrel collapses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, the jews also don&amp;#x27;t want picrel to collapse because then their banks would go broke. So we&amp;#x27;re stuck in hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891731&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882869&lt;br&gt;nice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891770&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889387&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;implying men would ever fuck someone below them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891847&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891770&lt;br&gt;are you literally retarded?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891874&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891847&lt;br&gt;Chad isn&amp;#x27;t fucking chubby chicks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891915&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;hmm thigh boots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892308&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886684&lt;br&gt;correct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Why is Eric Trump deleting all his WLFI and Ethereum posts? — 11 replies — 20.2/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893430</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893430?lm=1771892511</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:21:51 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Why is Eric Trump deleting all his WLFI and Ethereum posts?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61893430'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 11 • Updated: 2026-02-24 00:21 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is Eric Trump deleting all his WLFI and Ethereum posts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893439&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;br&gt;Because the drumpf family is about to be exposed for their crypto crimes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893440&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;br&gt;lol xD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893448&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good disgount obbortunities&lt;br&gt;Low brice&amp;#x27;s de de de&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;br&gt;lol when will these fools realize deleting doesn&amp;#x27;t do shit. once you post, it&amp;#x27;s there forever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893514&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;should we short WLFI bros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893518&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;br&gt;i hate to break it to you, but the trumps already made their money. they dumped their bags a long time ago and just pretending to still be invested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893519&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As much as a btc red dildo to 30k would hurt me mentally and physically, it&amp;#x27;s the only way link has a chance at climbing back into the top 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893521&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;br&gt;i told u about tether dude i warned u&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893576&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;br&gt;iran sheaningans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893620&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893521&lt;br&gt;Explain...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893636&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61893430&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Ai is about to crash the economy — 21 replies — 19.7/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889737</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889737?lm=1771890626</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 23:50:26 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Ai is about to crash the economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61889737'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 21 • Updated: 2026-02-23 23:50 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was released today by citrini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AI gets good. Companies lay off workers. Margins expand. Stocks rip. S&amp;amp;P hits 8,000. Everyone celebrates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• But fired workers stop spending. Companies weaken. They buy more AI to cut costs. More layoffs. Less spending. A negative feedback loop with no natural brake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• The top 10% of earners drive 50%+ of all consumer spending. They&amp;#x27;re the ones getting replaced. A $180K product manager ends up driving Uber for $45K. Multiply that across every major city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Ghost GDP emerges - the economy is &amp;quot;growing&amp;quot; on paper, but the money never reaches real people. Productivity is booming. Wages are collapsing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Then it hits housing. $13 trillion in mortgages, all underwritten on one assumption: you keep your job for 30 years. In 2008, the loans were bad on day one. In 2028, the loans were good. The world just changed after they were written.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• S&amp;amp;P crashes 38% from highs. Unemployment hits 10.2%. Markets barely react anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• The punchline: you&amp;#x27;re not reading this in 2028. You&amp;#x27;re reading it in February 2026. Every domino they describe has already started falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889750&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WAOW!

They hired way too many people for bullshit jobs and are now cutting back while saying it&amp;#x27;s because of AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of the shit is due to inflation, first from covid supply shocks, then companies trying to squeeze every last dollar they could out of the consumer and now trump tariffs. AI hasn&amp;#x27;t even begun to displace people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889814&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melanin inclined individuals all in on ai are so screwed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61889824&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889814&lt;br&gt;America fixed this problem already&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890898&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889750&lt;br&gt;This one is free https://www.citriniresearch.com/p/2028gic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61890971&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61889802&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you aren&amp;#x27;t just replacing a high value earner but someone that has tools that a.i doesn&amp;#x27;t have&lt;br&gt;They also take up 10x more energy heating their house&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61891766&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just tax AI and automation and introduce UBI.

Also, how the hell has Canton already beaten Link on market cap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892412&lt;br&gt;token not needed, it&amp;#x27;s going back to $1 mark my words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;most Linkies will rope themselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892462&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892441&lt;br&gt;Hello, I am a Linkie, can you help me?&lt;br&gt;Fud me out of my LINK tokens.&lt;br&gt;Like hit me with the hardest hitting fud you got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892484&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892462&lt;br&gt;you actively funded hundreds of Chainlink conferences in Africa (with your money) while making Sergey a billionaire (by being a loyal baggie)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892507&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892484&lt;br&gt;As a counterpoint, I&amp;#x27;d say that any globohomo adjacent project is obliged to partake in DEI nigger shit.&lt;br&gt;I mean that&amp;#x27;s all tech stocks nowadays too.&lt;br&gt;Or does any mag 7 only hire chuds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892549&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891559&lt;br&gt;This, it&amp;#x27;s going even lower than it did in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892576&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892072&lt;br&gt;Bad chart but it at least has a purpose that isn&amp;#x27;t just jewish fee capture. HBAR&amp;#x27;s tokenomics are brutal but it has a future in actual businesses and token use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892582&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891606&lt;br&gt;How do you feel about the thought of pregnant sergey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Link is &amp;gt;$1k, no one will give a fuck if they bought at $8, $10, or $4. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s not going much lower than this. When clarity passes, Link will moon the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892602&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892595&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;When clarity passes, Link will moon the hardest.&lt;br&gt;Who writes these jokes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61892611&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892582&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a Muslim man but I have to admit that pregnant Sergey really turns me on. I keep fantasizing about putting my seed inside him and watching new life grow... We get married, he gives birth, and we raise that baby under the blessings of Allah. I want to hold hands with Sergey, and looking into his eyes say &amp;#x27;I love you.&amp;#x27; I think of myself taking our son to his first day at school, watching that strong and masculine boy develop amazing computer skills like his dad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sergey would be the ideal partner for any man wishing to start a family. His great genes give him a combination of assertiveness, strength, and intelligence. If Sergey is able to get pregnant, he has to have a uterus; if he has a uterus, he can only be a woman in the eyes of Allah. ALLAHU AKHBAR!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, I can&amp;#x27;t hide this anymore. It&amp;#x27;s coming from deep inside of me... this desire to shout...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;M A GAY MUSLIM AND I HOLD CHAINLINK! Yes, and I am not the only one. I was attracted to this community because of the feeling of brotherhood that it creates. Together we are one. We are above gender divisions and categories. Chainlink, as you know, is a gay sex position where men stick their dicks into each other&amp;#x27;s asses to form a link.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, I declare Chainlink to be the currency of the LGBT community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;M GAY AND I HOLD CHAINLINK. YES! I&amp;#x27;M GAY AND I LOVE SERGEY! WOW! I&amp;#x27;M GAY AND YOU ARE TOO! TOGETHER, WE ARE GAY LINKIES AND NOTHING CAN STOP US!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;M GAY! AND I LOVE TO SAY IT! I&amp;#x27;M GAY, I&amp;#x27;M GAY, I&amp;#x27;M GAY AND I WORSHIP SERGEY! CHAINLINK! CHAINLINK! CHAINLINK!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NO MORE CHAINS, JUST LINKS!&lt;br&gt;NO MORE CHAINS, JUST LINKS!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893058&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61892595&lt;br&gt;here&amp;#x27;s some clarity for you:&lt;br&gt;YOU LOST&lt;br&gt;sell your stinks and pick up the pieces of your worthless life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waiting for $5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893081&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waiting for $81k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891507&lt;br&gt;You know you&amp;#x27;re going to really upset them by saying that.&lt;br&gt;Based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61893401&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61891507&lt;br&gt;Based. I&amp;#x27;m Funneling $6,000 a week for the next six weeks into LINK. And FudNIGGERS can tongue my anus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
