In history, people were religious because they were uneducated and most couldn&amp;#x27;t read. now people can read and are educated, but they aren&amp;#x27;t religious, but they also told that spiritual or religious hoo-hah is bull, the only thing that exists is what you see in front of you with your basic senses blah blah. When in fact, people should be using their educated brain to dig deeper. but it&amp;#x27;s all by design by the elites to continue obscuring the truths. they did it hundreds of years ago, and they continue to do it today just in a different way. READ THINGS. start with the bible. answers for a lot of things are in there. you don&amp;#x27;t need to be religious to read the bible and think critically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;then move upwards throughout history and you&amp;#x27;ll notice the pattern. these people are extremely, extremely religious/spiritual themselves. They are Yahwists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865913&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864842&lt;br&gt;Because the chinks are all retarded insects, its not supposed to be driven on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866587&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;it really is amazing how you can just go from fully alive, lots of possibilities to fully dead and nothing can be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866704&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866587&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could practice something called&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Defensive driving&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;or &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Not recklessly speeding on the shoulder&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;But yea nothing could have been done, the cagies claimed another scalp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866754&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864685&lt;br&gt;Pretty much this&lt;br&gt;I’m simultaneously never going to sell and never expecting it to go up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866776&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863681&lt;br&gt;I have to admit I wasn&amp;#x27;t a noticer but now I am kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866784&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864699&lt;br&gt;I need to re read the Art of War in this context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866977&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Something about if people breed fast, they die fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866980&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863681&lt;br&gt;this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866704&lt;br&gt;or just dont fucking ride a motorcycle. dumbest activity there is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867265&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;when I failed CFA Level 2 exam for the 3rd time&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realized it was only going to be normie life for me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867318&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864646&lt;br&gt;I think Missouri still has red light cameras&lt;br&gt;one thing that got shut down were speeding cameras in Arizona. if they try to mail you a speeding ticket, do nothing because they&amp;#x27;re fake and gay&lt;br&gt;in my opinion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867339&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864540&lt;br&gt;Very carefully&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867344&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864540&lt;br&gt;if he was going faster he would have passed before the car turned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867496&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;The fuck was he doing on the shoulder in the first place? It&amp;#x27;s obvious a vehicle can cut in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867614&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863947&lt;br&gt;Not a very good way to uplift and enlighten your brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867758&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863681&lt;br&gt;You do realize Epstein grew up in a working class family in brooklyn right? He is from &amp;quot;the real world&amp;quot;. He became a con artist to lift himself out of the lower class to &amp;quot;make it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867767&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;Its not too late for me yet. But it will be if I continue on the same path I am on now. Idk though for some reason I just cant motivate myself to do the things I want to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867775&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867758&lt;br&gt;He was a jew. Nothing they got away with was from the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867791&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865490&lt;br&gt;You have unmedicated schizophrenia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867813&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Eloquent.

What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends enormously on which country are we talking about. Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860837&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re shitting me right? As the other guy said it really varies based on the country, but in places like Italy you need 20 authorizations and 10 certifications (that you pay for) to open something like a bar or a carpentry shop, plus constant &amp;quot;controls&amp;quot; which are basically bribe requests at this point by officials of all kinds. Oh, and good luck filing your taxes. Here&amp;#x27;s how it goes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; be business owner&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; tax filing time (yay)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; because of course YOU need to tell the state how much the state wants from YOU&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; slightest fuck up? You&amp;#x27;re on the hook for 240% of the original amount&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; they have 5-7 years to come after you&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;oh hello here&amp;#x27;s a tax bill from 5 years ago cause you filed 3.51 euros less than you were supposed to, plus 1500 eur sanction, plus interest&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; oh btw you pay FIRST, and MAYBE when (after an average of 12 years in court at your expense) you are declared right, you get it back, no interest accrued, your legal expenses still on your back&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; so most people just pay&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; it&amp;#x27;s mafia with a hand of paint on top and the full force of the state behind it&lt;br&gt;EU is completely fucked. Stay away. We can just pray it somehow implodes from within. These bureaucrat jew lover good goyim will kill us all and replace us with shitskin and pajeets and they will feast on top of it all while the continent dies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860842&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because of course YOU need to tell the state how much the state wants from YOU&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; slightest fuck up?

I mean they&amp;#x27;re telling you know that you&amp;#x27;re ruled upon by a bunch of satanist jew pedophiles and there&amp;#x27;s no shooting in the streets, so there you have it. But at least you have the guns. If the Cheka comes knocking at your door demanding your harvest and your daughters, you can shoot back at the fuckers. Here in EU we&amp;#x27;re basically at the mercy of a state that hates us and wants us dead, and we have only our dicks to hold in our hands to defend ourselves from it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860860&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;As far as I keep reading on economic subreddits, negligible, the US just has far more available credit and tax companies a bit less at start allowing them to grow, otherwise its basically the same, sounds legit just a complacency issue from europeans, most of the time they get more unemployment benefits than they would working and have legit no time limit for them so they just don&amp;#x27;t bother lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860967&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;in my country, the one thing one has to look out for is paying for your own social/healthinsurance, ie, if you have your own business, you need to pay taxes for your own health/socialinsurance, and the taxman wont ask you for the first 3y of that business.&lt;br&gt;After the 3y pass, you will then have to payup all the retrospective social insurance tax costs incurred, which fucks over a lot of retard or unfortunate first business owners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861032&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;This is why we need a unified EU business regulation and undermind the corrupt sovereignist that want to keep individual burocratic fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861057&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Some are easy (Germany)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; some are very hard (Italy)&lt;br&gt;let me guess italian never tried germany?&lt;br&gt;Germany is known to be a bureucracy hellhole with people fleeing to other countries from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;unified will fix it&lt;br&gt;France&amp;amp;germany have been dictating eu lawmaking. You will eat shit as you already do. You have eu wide higher taxes because germany didnt want to compete and made mandatory higher minimum vat a thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to mention that countries that joined got their industries destroyed by unified regulation and had to import from germany/france what they used to produce themself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the one thing the USA gets right. I personally made a &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; (that never made any profit) in the span of an afternoon. Cost maybe $200 to get my identification numbers for the llc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861091&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;yeah let&amp;#x27;s give the EU bureaucrats more power that will fix it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;br&gt;Depends on the business. If you want to do something shady the US is the place to go. The US has barely any standards and barely any regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure&lt;br&gt;What are you talking about? I live currently in the EU and have never had to wait for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861119&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Us is easier.&lt;br&gt;I have created 2 corpos and 1 llc for different purposes within the past 8 years. You can do it all online for a few bucks, other regulations depend on specific industry but overall it&amp;#x27;s pretty easy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861128&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;higher taxation alone puts euros at a disadvantage. Its fine if you do a local job since you compete with locals but anything online / shipped its bad since they have to be more efficient than rest of world to reach same profit margin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for amount of bureaucracy its fucking complex and depends on what country and what profession. There is even stupid shit like if you run a repair shop and repair inside your building it counts different than if you decide to drive to your customer and repair locally. In the later case they classify you as a handyman worker and will fine you if you didn&amp;#x27;t register with the craftsman ministry. Also if you do something you didn&amp;#x27;t register for you will also be fined but you can register as &amp;quot; i will do anything&amp;quot; more broadly and dodge it. The amount of bullshit can easily fill a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends on what your goals are, the type of business, your personal goals and the markets you wish to enter. In general it&amp;#x27;s more of an investment in the long run but if you plan to offer your services or products in the EU anyway it makes sense to start your business here and already be compliant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure.&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I remember waiting decades for my appendicitis, it rupturing and me dying because of it. Thankfully they could keep me alive for months despite the extreme difficulties this poses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861032&lt;br&gt;We need more unified European regulation. Sadly the EU is not an economic alliance anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862545&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;I love how hard it is to even talk about european economy on reddit, not because of europeans, but because of american lefties, if you so much, and most times you don&amp;#x27;t even need to, mention the US, they will flock like a horde to claim the US lies about everything, that 30% of americans are unemployed and nearly no one in europe, the EU is literal worker&amp;#x27;s paradise and how much they love their welfare policies and hate the US greed, its quite hilarious really how much they want a nanny state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is, soon it will was once EU Inc comes into play&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yea but you have to wait 1 year+ because there is a million niggers in queue before you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865645&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861057&lt;br&gt;Lol this is true.&lt;br&gt;Germany and France made the EU suck with their shit like GDPR etc. Spain happily sniffs every turd. The rest aren&amp;#x27;t better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your efforts are starting to go anywhere, your own government will make sure, you won&amp;#x27;t get any further.&lt;br&gt;They hate nothing more than citizens that are not dependent on them. That&amp;#x27;s why they are allowing third world people in to the maximum extent physically possible, that are never going end up being a &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; on the balance sheet, but that they hope will be cheap voting sheep for their party. The people pay for them after all, not the party.&lt;br&gt;Effectively: If Elon Musk was a citizen of a EU-country, he&amp;#x27;d already be in jail waiting for the sentence to be sent to prison. You probably don&amp;#x27;t want to get into that situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866966&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865645&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Le GDPR sucks because uhm JUST LET ME HAVE YOUR DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867520&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861071&lt;br&gt;It’s also as easy in my country (Finland)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867536&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you get to keep more money&lt;br&gt;Except they have to pay more in taxes to wait in line for months whole muslim refugees who didnt pay go before them kek. Europeans are so dumb its unreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867540&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;italy here.&lt;br&gt;50% tax is ok ?&lt;br&gt;this is shITALY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867547&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s literally impossible to build any meaningful sized company in Europe because the entire E.U. is designed to prevent anyone from competing with the aristocratic class and the privately held billion dollar company their great great grandfather built in 1870.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860842&lt;br&gt;YOU DON&amp;#x27;T KNOW WHAT YOU&amp;#x27;RE TALKING ABOUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867577&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Europe has no tech industry because German rich fags were afraid to pay coders more than traditional engineers because then car engineers would ask for more money so they just fucked all of Europe and let America and China run everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868041&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;No, in some places is actually easy, I remember playing a game in class one time in uni to look regulations for business worldwide, there&amp;#x27;s almost no difference whatsoever in european and american regulations, sometimes american regulations are actually worse and the accumulated taxes from city, state, federal can surpass european taxes. The only conclusion we could draw was that europeans were just lazy and too laidback, they have so much welfare that there&amp;#x27;s no rush or anxiety with ending up destitute and homeless so they just don&amp;#x27;t bother with the hazzle of building a business. They are better off just being on benefits or unemployed, most business there predate the big social welfare network just because of a need to survive really and complacency in changing what already works, they are much much better off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Crypto has ruined my life honestly I’m 69, going 70. — 34 replies — 136.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61862685</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61862685?lm=1771371434</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 23:37:14 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Crypto has ruined my life honestly I’m 69, going 70.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61862685'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 34 • Updated: 2026-02-17 23:37 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crypto has ruined my life honestly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m 69, going 70.

I&amp;#x27;m in Rio since born and only today I realized that literally &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;every single person &lt;br&gt;finds my present self ugly, creepy and downright crazed looking &lt;br&gt;I honestly had&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no idea&lt;br&gt;A fat woman literally said&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;jesus christ &lt;br&gt;and it was about my looks. I used to look alright and even on the handsome side as a young man (my gf was a model when she left me).&lt;br&gt;I&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;never&lt;br&gt;even had a woman approach me during carnival and I see niggers with all kinds of beautiful women.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;one impregnated the blonde i was once in love with (she barely noticed me)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;it&amp;#x27;s all so tiresome &lt;br&gt;Keep up the faith anon.

He&amp;#x27;s got maybe 10-15 years of non-disabled life left and he&amp;#x27;s in massive debt to his own family. I mean, at least it&amp;#x27;s not a bank? Family is going to want him to die by the time he becomes disabled. If boomers weren&amp;#x27;t such greedy fucks they&amp;#x27;re kids wouldn&amp;#x27;t hate them so much. Imagine if the guy just invested in his children/grandchildren&amp;#x27;s inheritance instead of a fucking shitcoin? Then they would have no qualms about nursing him till his last breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863603&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862685&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;BSV&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;lol...faggot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;kys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864551&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862860&lt;br&gt;Kike subversion tactic.

Literally anyone can stack rocks.&lt;br&gt;I just think it&amp;#x27;s hilarious how much it upsets you jews that I&amp;#x27;m not being manipulated into throwing my wealth into the dumpster as you wish I would&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864664&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864627&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Literally literally&lt;br&gt;S.oylenial gamma male detected&lt;br&gt;We all know why you collect rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864682&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864451&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hehehe. You got it boss! Got your bullion right here!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OH SHIT MY BULLION WQS FAKE FUCKKKKKK SRY UNCLE SAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864455&lt;br&gt;This.&lt;br&gt;One of the first times I was buying some silver bullion coins from a store. There we&amp;#x27;re these 2 goblin looking jewish women, I slid over the moeny and before sliding me the coins she started telling me something along the lines of &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;Make sure to not open up these coins and don&amp;#x27;t touch them and don&amp;#x27;t even breath on them . . . blah blah blah . .. as it can affect the resale value . .. blah blah blah&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;.I never planned on selling and it made me immediately want to buy more. She hadn&amp;#x27;t even handed the coins over and was already dreaming of getting them back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864689&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Random, worthless corner of the internet discussing stacking physical PMs. All of a sudden, multiple users swarm the thread and are consistently active with sub30 minute replies at odd hours ready to shit on stackers immediately. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okie dokie. I understand why so many elements of Freemasonry, and secret societies strongly emphasize the lack of even appearing to be banded together behind the scenes. I totally understand why because anyone with a triple digit IQ will recognize when 20 to 30 people who don’t know each other all start, saying the same thing and attacking the same shit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once they outsourced all of this talking points to third world to cover online forums, the consistent attacks are essentially assigned that you are over the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864694&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864682&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would hate to be sitting in jail and have all of my wealth just out there, practically unsecured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864723&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864694&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice how this guy avoids all solid discussion, is consistently active, and only replies in quips and trolls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His secondary, will play the “reasonable” dissenter. Just pin this thread and watch, anons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864726&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864723&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What solid discussion would you like to have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864758&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;gets hacked&lt;br&gt;AAAAACCCCCK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864627&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I literally don&amp;#x27;t consider myself special&lt;br&gt;So then you literally know that literally most governments literally seize money when they want it bad enough and they have literally dealt with countless people who literally thought just because that money was literally in rock form the laws literally don&amp;#x27;t apply to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866917&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864804&lt;br&gt;Including your fiat, stocks, and crypto, except yours are way easier for them to confiscate.&lt;br&gt;Your point? OOH you don&amp;#x27;t have one. &lt;br&gt;Oh you&amp;#x27;re retarded? Poor thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864723&lt;br&gt;Then why engage? It&amp;#x27;s harder to ignore retards in real life but I still manage, but online there&amp;#x27;s no reason to even pretend. Everyone that gets ventilated by bad advice just makes your assets that much more valuable. Pretend like everyone average and below will face starvation, prostitution, conscription and death; the truth isn&amp;#x27;t far from this. You wouldn&amp;#x27;t spend all day arguing with corpses so why would you spend time on someone that doesn&amp;#x27;t know they are dead yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867144&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866917&lt;br&gt;This is really the bull case cry for stacking firearms and putting aside enough to buy sell swords. The government will do anything they think they can get away with which I why I don&amp;#x27;t think even bail ins are certain, you can do those overnight without kicking a single door but there will still be hell to pay in the morning. While stackers are a smaller population most holdings require, or rather will at such time require, going door to door to seize assets in a country in which one can put together an AR for $350-$400 and drop in FRTs can be had for as little as $100. All this against the population and asset class pairing most likely to own firearms. The logistics don&amp;#x27;t make sense. You&amp;#x27;ll see heavy taxes, threats of taxes, capital controls and possibly if briefly bans on sales after a set date. None of this yields as much gold or silver as paying an above market rate. Question is, is there anything worth trading for. If I got a deed to a substantial amount of the land the federal government loves to horde so much I could see myself parting with all (some) of my specie. Nobody can be all stick and no carrot and win. This is why in bank bail ins you atleast get shares in a bank that has recently defaulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867175&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867144&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re lucky you&amp;#x27;re but a minnow.

Turns out no one will just &amp;#x27;let&amp;#x27; you be useful to society while making 150k a year working 80 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863856&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863822&lt;br&gt;He&amp;#x27;s just gonna tell you you&amp;#x27;re a loser and to get an apartment with a crackhead roommate or something. Your parents are the problem for not hooking you up with a year of rent and a job if they don&amp;#x27;t want you around. American parents deserve everything coming to them for stealing from their own kids. Who the fuck thinks they can just peace out and retire when society is collapsing lmao. Anyone who says &amp;quot;not my problem, I&amp;#x27;ll be dead by the time it gets REAL bad&amp;quot; is a person I conside rit my duty to cause as much suffering as posible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds like your whole family is dead weight except your mom. The perfume and makeup is probably a desperate move to hopefully find a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863922&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863856&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Anyone who says &amp;quot;not my problem, I&amp;#x27;ll be dead by the time it gets REAL bad&amp;quot; is a person I conside rit my duty to cause as much suffering as posible for.&lt;br&gt;They&amp;#x27;ll all be abused by Indians in the retirement home while their actual children are estranged. Poetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864141&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863622&lt;br&gt;How old are you, OP? Sounds like your family is financially abusive to you. Can you move out on your own (as soon as you find a job, I mean) and cut contact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863822&lt;br&gt;It really isn&amp;#x27;t. You can live VERY cheaply in a lot of Asian countries (Thailand, Laos, Indonesia) and do ridiculously low-paying remote work and still come out with net savings every month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I worked in Taiwan (DON&amp;#x27;T GO THERE) for a while and was able to save over 50% of my pay even though I made half as much as an American would make doing the same job (not ESLosering).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wish I hadn&amp;#x27;t because it completely destroyed my health permanently (they&amp;#x27;re just as bad, maybe worse, about dumping toxic industrial chemicals in food as the mainland chinsects), but it was the only thing available to me after the 2008-12 crash during the Obamaconomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;corner your dad and mom about that 600+1.8k+10k$. That&amp;#x27;ll make them shut for another 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864358&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;neet sister who also has 2 neet sons and a neet daughter.&lt;br&gt;nigga how old are you? &lt;br&gt;or are you calling infants neets kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864379&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;What the fuck does your retarded family have to do with the economy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864420&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864358&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;her neet sister&lt;br&gt;His aunt is the neet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864425&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863648&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863643&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;just go get killed for ZOG!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only military worth joining is the russian one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864222&lt;br&gt;These are classic case narcissists or sociopaths. They’ll become affronted, say something along the lines of ‘none of your business’ and if they are reticent then it would most certainly be for lip service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864434&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864425&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;just go get killed for ZOG (east)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864449&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863643&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863648&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863852&lt;br&gt;Wow the sõyjack party leaks were true this place is infested with glowies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864425&lt;br&gt;come on dude&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864740&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864358&lt;br&gt;My neet aunts children are in there fucking 40s and never worked jobs yet live like kings.

I can barely function and the few years I worked a job I was tempted to drive my car into oncoming traffic every single day to and back from work &lt;br&gt;Col is just too high plus I can&amp;#x27;t get a good paying job&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864222&lt;br&gt;Have you read a certain painters description of a certain group of people being like jelly when you argue with them? It&amp;#x27;s impossible to discuss anything with these animals I have for parents. They forget everything the next day and gaslight you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864763&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864743&lt;br&gt;My dad already does and she fucking loves it.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile I slightly raise my voice to make sure she can hear me and she goes berserk calling me an asshole who&amp;#x27;ll never get women cuz I have no job meanwhile my dad gambled 200k on stock margins in the 90s and lost his job for a decade and she still dutifully stuck with him. It&amp;#x27;s comical how everyday my dad cusses her out and yells at her calling her a dumb bitch at the top of his lungs and she&amp;#x27;ll dutifully have dinner ready for him in an hour while washing all his clothes for him yet she&amp;#x27;ll scold me for not cooking my own food even though I never asked her to cook for me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864768&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;He keeps sending me job openings in other states/cities that require 10+ years of experience and he tells me &amp;quot;just walk up to them and ask them to train you, that&amp;#x27;s how we did it back in the old days&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;my dad used to do this&lt;br&gt;holy shit it pissed the fuck out of me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864763&lt;br&gt;She loves getting beat?&lt;br&gt;Huh&lt;br&gt;Wonder if she’d love getting her pussy beat into smithereens. Tell your dad to try that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864795&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863604&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;Ironically the same people who make these demoralisation threads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863856&lt;br&gt;Average zoomer blaming everyone but themselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865867&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864888&lt;br&gt;explain how he&amp;#x27;s wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865875&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863594&lt;br&gt;She&amp;#x27;s not wrong that you need to contribute just because she&amp;#x27;s also bad with money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867123&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864751&lt;br&gt;so how does this work, do you pay them a fix amount as your part of rent and costs or do they just siphon off as much as possible or procentual off your incone? you said you have savings so it&amp;#x27;s probably not completely fucked. not sure how much you need a month for them to get off your back. what industry? you drive a car to work so not remote despite crippling autism?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863622&lt;br&gt;Anon what if your mother is selling herself to make ends meet? She needs that perfume and make up to pay the bills. Unironically if you aren&amp;#x27;t pitching in now and haven&amp;#x27;t for 6 months then you should do better. Looking through her purse is fucking shameful. Perhaps she is lying but if so go get your own place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve posted a few times where to apply to true entry level jobs that I have experience with that can keep the poors alive before but few ever seem to listen or care. I say all this to say, the situation is pretty bad but giving up and requiring &amp;amp; critiquing your mother to whore herself out night after night is not going to get you out of the hole any faster. If you&amp;#x27;re drowning and a very poor swimmer with little hope of survival do you drown in hopes that one of the John&amp;#x27;s throw you a life jacket or do you try to stay above water in the off chance another opportunity presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867268&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864768&lt;br&gt;As you get older you&amp;#x27;ll likely see the tables flip. My dad got laid off and couldn&amp;#x27;t get another job in the same field to save his life. You may be tempted to turn things around on them and give them boomerisms but I instead called in a bunch of favors to try and get him a job and coached him on some he was applying to for key words and anticipated knowledge checks in interviews. They often don&amp;#x27;t know what the receiving end is like because they haven&amp;#x27;t seen it for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867891&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867123&lt;br&gt;Yes I have to contribute some to our monthly bills and stuff &lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t find any remote jobs accepting white autistic males&lt;br&gt;I even tried the whole night security guard job alot of neets recommended and got ghosted &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867223&lt;br&gt;Please do post again that info on how to get entry level jobs if you don&amp;#x27;t mind &lt;br&gt;Might something I haven&amp;#x27;t tried yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868034&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t have to like it but if you&amp;#x27;re poor and you&amp;#x27;re entire family is poor, you have four paths to get out: crime, sucking dick, entertainment, or the military. Of the 4, the military is the safest.

Idc, US is a shithole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m sure people will respond saying I&amp;#x27;m cherry picking. Dishonesty is rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865659&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857779&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Foreign money taking investments out of the US because trump is an unpredictable fucking moron being puppeteered by unironically evil people&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;American dollar has lost 10% of its value over the course of 2025&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Constant tariff bullshitery that is objectively hurting American industries that rely on imports&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nuked basedbean deal with China on top of farmers needing a fucking bailout because of the retard they voted in (again)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Tourism industry cratering every day as we speak so even less money being injected into the economy &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ICE operation have caused businesses across the country to shut down because either no one&amp;#x27;s willing to go out, or because they don&amp;#x27;t want random goons in masks harassing employees&lt;br&gt;Dude it&amp;#x27;s actually impressive how hard these retards just destroyed the entire reputation of america abroad and fucked us over domestically, but his cult fan base and circle of wannabe oligarchs who own media outlets will continue telling you that there is no war in ba sing se&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865663&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861063&lt;br&gt;We really need to do what the Chinese do with making sure household consumption as share of GDP is increasing. Actually reflects living standards instead of billions of dollars getting spitswapped between 3-4 different AI companies constantly. Then again, most of the people hear would just ree hearing the term “5 year plan” or “stability focused infrastructure development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865674&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865585&lt;br&gt;MIGAtrannies will happily eat shit if a libtard has to smell their breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865800&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865585&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;US is a shithole&lt;br&gt;and the usa still gives you about the best chance in the world to improve your life if you come from humble beginnings&lt;br&gt;altho it also offers you every temptation possible to make you drive yourself over the financial cliff at every turn at the same time it offers you opportunity&lt;br&gt;just know its far worse everywhere else as society in general is reverting back to medieval style caste based system of neither hope nor escape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865942&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865800&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and the usa still gives you about the best chance in the world to improve your life if you come from humble beginnings&lt;br&gt;this has not been true in at least 20-25 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866035&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865942&lt;br&gt;lol, lmao&lt;br&gt;then give me the list of countries that you think arent just better today but were better 20 years ago and i&amp;#x27;ll have a good laugh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and to clarify we are specifically talking about giving chances to poor unconnected people so dont say retarded shit like liechtenstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866071&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865800&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he fell for the meme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866130&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860705&lt;br&gt;None of these are necessary. We could be totally self-sufficient, even for things like rare-earths. The Epstein class decided that would be bad for them so we aren&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866186&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866130&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;pharmaceuticals are not necessary &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;input goods for new tech are not necessary &lt;br&gt;Uh huh. So what’s necessary? Shovels, canned food and farmland? If you want to be Amish so badly just do it, nobody is stopping you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the real world, though, self-sufficiency would entail access to pharmaceuticals and the ability to evolve technologically and keep up with the first world. We can sing songs all day about how the US could be self-sufficient one day and that’s fine. The point is that we aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866130&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re retarded if you actually believe this. Even IF we could be self sufficient, and make everything we need ourselves (we can&amp;#x27;t) the price of everything would fucking skyrocket to the point that most people wouldn&amp;#x27;t be able to afford common items that we have now like tvs and phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857508&lt;br&gt;THE DOW IS AT 6 MILLION!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866632&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866312&lt;br&gt;Key difference was that things lasted and were repairable, only people what would suffer would be consoomer types.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;TVs&lt;br&gt;No one would complain if smart TVs stopped existing, and anything above 4k is a meme&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Smartphones&lt;br&gt;Make them with weaker specs and optimize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866648&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857490&lt;br&gt;anyone who isn&amp;#x27;t low iq or the most subhuman subspecies on the planet (miggers) already knew this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857763&lt;br&gt;Why the fuck would a McDonalds hire an engineer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>This shit got me finna kms ONG!!! — 31 replies — 61.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866292</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866292?lm=1771370446</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 23:20:46 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;This shit got me finna kms ONG!!!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61866292'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 31 • Updated: 2026-02-17 23:20 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shit got me finna kms ONG!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866346&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866292&lt;br&gt;omg dude imagine sitting by a lake. or you could take a nap on some flowers... whoa that would be so much better than working for shekelberg!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866589&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866292&lt;br&gt;bros i might have to start waging soon..it..it cant be that bad...r...righ..ACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866689&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the goyim deal in the real world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866689&lt;br&gt;hahaha the files have been so fucking eye opening. everything we said about jews right there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866707&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866292&lt;br&gt;born to live like an animal! eating and fucking and basking in neurotransmitters!&lt;br&gt;forced to do human bullshit! high-level concerns no animal can even begin to comprehend!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866711&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866292&lt;br&gt;BUMP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866715&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;all you lazy fucking gen alphoids and zoomers don&amp;#x27;t seem to realize that you weren&amp;#x27;t born to lay around fingering your gay assholes.&lt;br&gt;You were born to work even harder just to survive than you need to nowadays, including daily running and chasing down animals for miles with spears, with your tribe to eat, or if you are lucky, fishing and back breaking farming, but thosecame with risks of your shit being plundered or you going hungry if unsuccessful.&lt;br&gt;EVERY DAY was life or death struggles, entitled morons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866726&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866715&lt;br&gt;We don&amp;#x27;t live in the jungle any more, you boomer rat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866740&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866715&lt;br&gt;not to mention once you were 30+ years old, you were as good as dead.&lt;br&gt;if a disease didn&amp;#x27;t get you, a competing younger tribe would murder you, or even your own tribe would because your strength, speed, and usefulness ran out, BYTCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866752&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866726&lt;br&gt;doesn&amp;#x27;t change the fact that you and OP were born to suffer, struggle and die even more horribly than you are now.&lt;br&gt;No one owes you anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866756&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866740&lt;br&gt;I agree everyone over 30 should die horribly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866770&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866756&lt;br&gt;so do something about it, pussy.&lt;br&gt;your generation are the biggest groups of fags and pussies.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m 39, and I&amp;#x27;m waaaitiiin&amp;#x27;&lt;br&gt;come on.&lt;br&gt;Do something, BYTCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866997&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866292&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t get what I am looking at or missing?

Everyone knows there’s some evil Jews out there, same applies to every other group. Most Jews aren’t rich billionaires, they’re actually pretty poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867501&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867492&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;absolutist language&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;false equivalence&lt;br&gt;Damage control spotted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867503&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867492&lt;br&gt;And yet they continue to enable the same practices as the elite jews. Also, jews arent poor like you or I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867525&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866715&lt;br&gt;Kill yourself boomer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866756&lt;br&gt;Kill yourself zoomer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867109&lt;br&gt;Yeah porn and corn syrup is so fulfilling &lt;br&gt;Having a tribe that you would live and die for would suck. I’d rather interact with Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867830&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;wow very original post&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867836&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866715&lt;br&gt;Actually most hunter gatherers just laid around all day. Medieval peasants only worked about half the year.

If they go back to gold coins there will be some catch. If the jew embraces something, try to move as far away from that as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864708&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855597&lt;br&gt;BTCFi is giving it more use cases with Babylon leading the charge. And I think when we have more projects offering native BTC staking, then we will see the narrative go viral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864667&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Try something somebody actually said&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;literally you on every general&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;almost you entirely&lt;br&gt;Cry me some diodes, clanker.&lt;br&gt;Nerva is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864897&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva is here to stay.&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t care if it stays as long as you stop smearing XMR and spamming our threads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864948&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864897&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I don&amp;#x27;t care if it stays as long as you stop smearing XMR and spamming our threads&lt;br&gt;The only spammer is you, in both this thread and the xmr general. You came here to start shit and have done so in every privacy thread that has popped up. You also accuse everyone of being a poojeet and promoting nerva. Again, the only person promoting (xmr in your case) and causing a stink has been YOU. So fuck off back to your little monero hole, jeetbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864948&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The only spammer is you,&lt;br&gt;I wish that were true but sadly the nervajeets constantly try to shit up our thread and this board. There&amp;#x27;s a reason all of these anti-Monero threads pop up when they lose the discussion in the general. Notice how quiet they&amp;#x27;ve become after &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860646 was posted. All of their anti-Monero arguments (which was the entire value proposition for nerva) are gone. Their questions they claim never were answered poofed up into air. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You came here to start shit&lt;br&gt;OP literally accuses XMR of being some freemason bullshit. You&amp;#x27;re the perfect representation of the jew asking what harm he has done to us. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You also accuse everyone of being a poojeet and promoting nerva.&lt;br&gt;No, I say that the ones that copy all of the points the nervajeets make to be a nervajeets. That&amp;#x27;s because the only people interested in nerva are jeets.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Please don&amp;#x27;t challenge me when I smear the only functional crypto currency please just go away I can&amp;#x27;t handle it please please please&lt;br&gt;No sar, you wish to talk about XMR? I&amp;#x27;ll be there and refute each on of your pathetic claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865161&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865014&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;bot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865268&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862698&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864651&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865161&lt;br&gt;good morning nervasaaars&lt;br&gt;truly xnv is the most aryan bharatoken superior peer-to-poop privacy coin xnvsaars redeem asap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865268&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;i cant stop sucking monero dick, am i gay enough yet?

That chain doesn&amp;#x27;t exist at all on BTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866407&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866384&lt;br&gt;why so mad saar&lt;br&gt;the nerva discord isn&amp;#x27;t paying (you) enough to raid 4chan?&lt;br&gt;do not redeem the mod ban saar stop evading bans saar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866671&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849447&lt;br&gt;they all go to zero if btc dies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;bitch about Nerva shills on XMR threads&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ban/delete whenever they make a Nerva general&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;leave countless shit threads untouched&lt;br&gt;This is exactly why Nerva exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your “decentralized privacy coin community” is so threatened by the existence of a CPU-only alternative that mods have to memoryhole any discussion, that’s not confidence, that’s insecurity and gatekeeping. You can’t preach censorship resistance while censoring competition like a reddit janny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monero is the king today, nobody denies that. But watching a Monero mod rageban any Nerva thread while allowing endless garbage posts just proves the point. A privacy movement that can’t tolerate parallel projects is already compromised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cope harder. Nerva isn’t going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866695&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866583&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866688&lt;br&gt;ChatGPT moment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866712&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866695&lt;br&gt;Cope. Also trips and dubs of truth. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866688&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866728&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866712&lt;br&gt;Getting rugged by Zcash jews is one thing but imagine getting rugged by Nerva jeets I would kms lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866805&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865124&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;go away monegro.&lt;br&gt;Stop talking about my coin and stop coming to my general and I will tolerate your kind&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;because they were never spamming up your threads in the first place you pathetic fucking loser.&lt;br&gt;We had this argument already. Over 40 pro-nerva posts in just the current XMR general. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;they were just asking questions&lt;br&gt;All of their questions were already answered, I asked them multiple times to ask any unanswered questions and it&amp;#x27;s been a few days since then. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;something anyone can do.&lt;br&gt;How come they never can answer my questions then? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;your clearly the psychopath across every fucking one.&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;d rather be a psycho than a jeetcoin shill&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Non stop blogposts of text that do nothing but go in circles, and now youre doing it here. Save yourself some time and go shit up someone elses thread. Oh right, you cant, because youre a monegro botnet that works for monero glowies.&lt;br&gt;Or maybe stop smearing Monero and actually try to have some arguments? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I started this thread to discuss privacy coins&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I always also start a discussion by posting schizo BS criticizing the only proven tool. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all youve done is shit up my thread you piece of shit.&lt;br&gt;And you don&amp;#x27;t like it? Looks like I&amp;#x27;m justified in my behavior towards the jeets. Of course I am. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865161&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;picrel&lt;br&gt;See &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61809820 and &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860646 Your questions already have been answered. Please let me know if you have any other questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865595&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re literally sucking off nerva and the current govt. The best part is that all of your arguments regarding epstein and monero are easily extrapolated towards nerva too. It wouldn&amp;#x27;t be too hard to invite your devs to the island considering 40% of them publicly dox themselves and the other ones use discord which always required PII to sign up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865847&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CryptoNight-Adaptive &amp;gt; RandomX for decentralization&lt;br&gt;How do you prevent CPUs being clustered locally? Furthermore, how do you plan to detect a 51% attack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866813&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865869&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva generals get took down immediately.&lt;br&gt;Your jeetcoin is just Monero but no dev work since 2018. It hasn&amp;#x27;t even been maintained. Literally all you do is shill your bags and all of this started because you got relisted by jews. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Your jewish glowcoin is gonna hit zero,&lt;br&gt;Oh I&amp;#x27;m sure all of the DNMs will switch from Monero to your unmaintained mess. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;All you do is advertise monero on here, yet you never get banned.&lt;br&gt;No, all I do is defend Monero against your retarded attacks. That&amp;#x27;s why I&amp;#x27;m always bringing up your fake arguments and refute them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865998&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;No way a thread gets bumped off this board that fast.&lt;br&gt;Happened a few times with jeetcoin generals now. There&amp;#x27;s simply no interest in your little project. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Mods are afraid of it.&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#x27;s the dangerous part? The low ring size? The lack of development? The lack of any other feature? The ease with which one can 51% it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866373&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Yet the mods and XMR fags are the ones who started all this.&lt;br&gt;Just stay out of our general and don&amp;#x27;t smear us and your jeetcoin will be tolerated among the other scams that get posted on this board. Yes, you too can be as beloved as the cheese poster or that guy who posts something that looks like the Yen symbol but with an X. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866384&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;We totally don&amp;#x27;t know about this project&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Anyway I got the screenshot of the general from their discord and weirdly all of my arguments just come from there&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866583&lt;br&gt;Your jeetcoin got relisted. That&amp;#x27;s why some baggie started promoting it in the first place &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nerva was just relisted (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61747926)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866821&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866688&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;bitch about Nerva shills on XMR threads&lt;br&gt;Correct, stop pestering us&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ban/delete whenever they make a Nerva general&lt;br&gt;No need to when they die after two hours anyway lol&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;leave countless shit threads untouched&lt;br&gt;Most shit threads don&amp;#x27;t just push indian coins&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CPU-only alternative&lt;br&gt;Nigger, RandomX is CPU only. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Monero is the king today, nobody denies that&lt;br&gt;Then why shit on it always? Why even try to move away from it to a clearly inferior product in every metric? Why do you need some community in the first place? We have an economy we care about.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;A privacy movement that can’t tolerate parallel projects is already compromised.&lt;br&gt;So can you tolerate our general not existing to push your cowshit coin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866885&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s make a deal. Let us have our Nerva General and we&amp;#x27;ll stay out of XMR Generals. I think it&amp;#x27;s a pretty simple and straightforward solution. If everyone is so worried about this &amp;quot;jeetcoin&amp;quot; then let us have our containment thread and fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61866961&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866885&lt;br&gt;1. Not up for us to decide&lt;br&gt;2. You already had your generals, they die out anyway and you still feel a need to infiltrate our generals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866805&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Stop talking about my coin and stop coming to my general and I will tolerate your kind&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;doesnt know where hes at or what hes doing, apparently&lt;br&gt;Also, I started this general and one of the jannies banned me. Why? ban these monegros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867055&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867008&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and this isnt a nerva thread and never was&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah OP just stole the picture from a nervajeet and pretends to be oblivious to it despite being in the general in which nerva had to be mentioned over 140 times already&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They are shitting up other threads &lt;br&gt;We got inspired by you it seems. Maybe stop trying to psyop people regarding our coin.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and advertising XMR, &lt;br&gt;We&amp;#x27;re refuting your FUD and asking you questions which you can never answer. That&amp;#x27;s because all you do is literally just put out ads for your jeetcoin&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and abusing their cuck jannie powers to ban people who disagree with them, then his little buddy starts asking me to &amp;quot;stop evading bans&amp;quot; and pretending theyre not deleting actual nerva threads.&lt;br&gt;How about the generals that don&amp;#x27;t get deleted and then die from your community consisting solely of five jeets?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They started it the day they took a shit on someone asking about nerva and have been shitting up every non monero thread since.&lt;br&gt;Funny thing to say when nerva jeets admit to being in multiple threads not related to nerva and even pol to promote their cowshit coin&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Im sick of seeing them shit everywhere every time a privacy coin thread pops up.&lt;br&gt;Stop spreading FUD&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Either remove the XMR general for advertising,&lt;br&gt;It isn&amp;#x27;t. It&amp;#x27;s refuting your claims. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;leave privacy threads and nerva threads/anons alone.&lt;br&gt;Your kind infiltrated our thread. You are supposed to leave us alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867018&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;doesnt know where hes at or what hes doing, apparently&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m in the thread that just spreads fud about Monero from the very beginning.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Why?&lt;br&gt;Because you&amp;#x27;re an obvious nervajeet that spreads FUD so his bags get bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867250&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867201&lt;br&gt;They are just asking questions chud!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867425&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867384&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;, you all didnt even post a response to the view key fud thats even worth a damn till yesterday&lt;br&gt;Check out &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61761926. What&amp;#x27;s worse is that, your cohort started with the questions from reddit but the post you mentioned had the answer THREE YEARS AGO. &lt;br&gt;Your question had been answered THREE YEARS before you even posed it. On the platform you all preferred. Have any of you gone back and said something like &amp;#x27;Thanks for telling me about this&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;Well this eases my mind&amp;#x27; or &amp;#x27;Guess I was wrong&amp;#x27;? Of course not. You attached yourself to FUD so you can shill your bags. If you all cared you could&amp;#x27;ve easily done the research anon did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867695&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;9+ comments deleted for questioning/pointing out privacy concerns with XMR&lt;br&gt;Totally normal behavior, nothing to see here. Make sure to buy fednero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867720&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867695&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;We just have questions&lt;br&gt;Which ones?

It&amp;#x27;s a networking site.&lt;br&gt;I add the maximum number of connections every week in my industry targeted at companies I might want to work for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864306&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn is full of indians&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864249&lt;br&gt;handshake.firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865182&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, careerbuilder. it’s jam packed with indians but once a week I got a good lead from a mag7 recruiter and one of them hired me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865294&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;80% of job openings are fake and just HRM wasting everyone&amp;#x27;s time.&lt;br&gt;19.999999% of jobs go to nepo hire scum, so you never had a chance anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865452&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;job boards &lt;br&gt;Head hunters are the new meta. Have fun competing with 20000 AI resumes in every application tho lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865518&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;Yes. However they are private job boards for your colleges. My college has it&amp;#x27;s own job board for students and alumni and most of the postings there I&amp;#x27;ve noticed are not on LinkedIn or Indeed. Game is pay to play, it&amp;#x27;s cringe. Sorry bro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61865532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said even that isn&amp;#x27;t that helpful since those postings just take you to the hiring companies website where you still run into the same problems of competing with h1b pennies on the dollar wagies and having your resume filtered by ai to look for certain keywords and interviewing with fat liberal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867272&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865518&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865532&lt;br&gt;God why does job hunting have to be the ultimate humiliation ritual. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;start a business!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure. If I was more smart and clever and had any ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;When I see a job posting on linkedin or some other gay job board I go to the company&amp;#x27;s website and apply there directly instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;yes put your resume here many people get jobs from /biz/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867416&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61865452&lt;br&gt;hey [full legal name] yo mate whatsup I am Jake Andrews and just saw your profile in one of my specialized searches. I am based out of London and studied exercise sport science and use my unique background to help connect outgoing engineers like yourself find awesome jobs. I got an amazing career opportunity as [random skill you marked on linkedin] at this awesome up and coming company based out of flyover town USA. Salary is competitive but I won&amp;#x27;t tell you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now it seems like the only way to get one through connections. No one is hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Ireland, recruiters are actually pretty good and you can build a network through them. Unfortunately I&amp;#x27;m not in Ireland now and all Irish jobs are hybrid. European based roles naturally require working fluency in another language and that&amp;#x27;s a bridge too far at the moment, even though I speak 3 other languages to various degrees&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn seems to be quite tricky to stand out through even with customised CVs (via AI) for every application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, competition and noise are both high. Personal connections are still far and away your best option (if they are an option)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867924&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed is full of scam postings, so not that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve tried welcometothejungle.com for applying to remote jobs, but since they&amp;#x27;re remote, don&amp;#x27;t really expect to get an interview - competition is still sky high since everyone&amp;#x27;s laid off now. Job market&amp;#x27;s totally fucked all around, so any workarounds you might find are already oversaturated. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867934&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve just passed the second round of interviews for two different jobs, both off of LinkedIn. I don&amp;#x27;t know of any others that are really comparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867939&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864195&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;by Microslop&lt;br&gt;Holy retard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867948&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867939&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t.

That means that what most people think of when they think &amp;quot;arts major&amp;quot; (fine arts, animation, etc.) are better-employed than criminal justice majors. They&amp;#x27;re better employed than med techs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marinate on that for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867150&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867099&lt;br&gt;Have you tried walking into google and giving Sundar a firm handshake, kiddo... That&amp;#x27;s what we used to do back in our day... Look him in the eyes and let him know you&amp;#x27;ll do whatever in takes... Extra hours, sleeping at the office... Kids these days just don&amp;#x27;t have the grit we used to have... That&amp;#x27;s why we sent men to the moon, 6 times at that, yes sir...&lt;br&gt;You gotta pay your dues, and you gotta be in it to win it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867192&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867094&lt;br&gt;A lot of people who do Criminal Justice degrees are people who watched CSI etc and want to solve murders or do forensics rather than law or general policing or whatever. The actual amount of jobs available for that field is extremely small&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;That graph is basically flatlined lol. There are things to be alarmed about, but is this really one of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867228&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do any of these stats even matter. This shit is just fud for you a couple of years now I&amp;#x27;ve been seeing so much shit like this but than nothing ever happens because of it people just move on like it doesn&amp;#x27;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867266&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867214&lt;br&gt;Tbh it shows we&amp;#x27;ve been on an unsustainable path for, at minimum, the duration of the x axis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867303&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867192&lt;br&gt;Because the laws they want to change, for the better, get rejected. We need a giga wipe of all the branches. All senators and shit, GONE. We need new blood instead of fucking 98 yr old Strom Thurman fuckers voting for shit. 2 terms, 3 years each. President only gets 2 terms, 8 years and that&amp;#x27;s it, why do THEY get to fucking stay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867341&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;This is a complete lie. Trump doubled steel production in one year. The economy has never been better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867436&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;good to know...ill start spending less to help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867442&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;I voted for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not using the criminal justice degree to do some criminal justice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867538&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867094&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61866972&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;medical technicians&lt;br&gt;You go to college for &amp;#x27;useful&amp;#x27; degrees like compsci and medicine and then you&amp;#x27;re unemployed. Womp womp should have become a mechanic. Oh wait I did that too and applied to be a mechanic at the place 5 minutes up the road and they told me they already got three guys but need an inspector if I want to pay for inspection courses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know the real fucked up part? I was gonna invest 100k into BTC at 20k back in 2022. I would have been pretty much set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867546&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867228&lt;br&gt;The news just gaslights people about how millennials all somehow got 6 figure careers and some fag on /biz/ will always reply to posts like this liek &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m 36 and everyone I know is making 200k a year&amp;quot; and then will refuse to actually explain what he does or make up a fanciful story about dropshipping businesses and ebay magic, nevermind that I tried the ebay business route and that shit is too high in fees to be worth anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867341&lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t believe they did this. Are we staffed by a bunch of slimy kikes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867099&lt;br&gt;Apply for clerk at the post office. It&amp;#x27;s just as gay but 22/hr and there&amp;#x27;s no real interview&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t. Chemical engineer working for the post office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867634&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867341&lt;br&gt;fucking kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867655&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867608&lt;br&gt;Become a patent clerk instead. It’s a good job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;t. knower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867705&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867595&lt;br&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t know that they&amp;#x27;ve been manipulating the basket of goods used to calculate CPI increases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
