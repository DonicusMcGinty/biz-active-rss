NO! NO! Only WE&amp;#x27;RE allowed to devalue our currency because WE need WAGESLAVES more than YOU! Y..you can&amp;#x27;t just print to build infrastructure!!! That&amp;#x27;s communist!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875074&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875052&lt;br&gt;I think the euros are more upset with china’s devaluation than America is. The guy in that article complaining is German. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re instantiating a levy on small goods in July to combat the yuan that refuses to budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875077&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875001&lt;br&gt;How it&amp;#x27;s done? They just keep it tied to the dollar. What are you talking about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875121&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875077&lt;br&gt;It isn’t strictly tied to the dollar. It WAS before 2005, but now it’s a managed float system that is managed by the central bank. The dollar plays a big role, but it isn’t as if the yuan keeps strict pace with the dollar. They can (and do) manage its exchange rate. Exactly how they determine what the exchange rate should be is the opaque part. One way they manage the yuan’s value is by buying/selling dollars with their currency, and this is one reason why the keep so many dollars in reserve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is also why, earlier in the thread, I argued that the dollar’s role as a reference point for a currency can still cause it to be accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875124&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;Sour fucking grapes. The Jews running the west are such idiots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875149&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875074&lt;br&gt;Germans don&amp;#x27;t even believe in debt, they had a rule in their constitution that they couldn&amp;#x27;t borrow more than 0.35% of GDP annually until 2025 when shit hit the fan for needing to build a real military.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Reee we aren&amp;#x27;t taking on debt so you can&amp;#x27;t either reeee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875160&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873120&lt;br&gt;They’re disgusting gook bugmen that are not human&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875205&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874965&lt;br&gt;A currency cannot be &amp;quot;undervalued&amp;quot;, because there is no &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;inherent&amp;quot; value for a currency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China keeps its currency stable relative to other currencies, mainly USD, to avoid currency exchange risk for exporting and importing companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China has a ridiculous surplus because (a) Chinese companies are ridiculously competitive, (b) Chinese companies are not allowed to import the kind of things they want to import because of export controls, (c) Chinese companies are afraid an over-dependence on imports will lead to them being rug-pulled by new export controls or piracy, and (d) the CPC has a &amp;quot;minimize China&amp;#x27;s dependence on others, maximize others&amp;#x27; dependence on China&amp;quot; philosophy on how to win trade wars and avoid shooting wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875302&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875205&lt;br&gt;Just because there isn’t an underlying physical commodity to back the currency doesn’t mean that the currency can’t still be undervalued (or overvalued). Parity for currencies, even currencies in a fiat system, is one way that this is calculated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a basket of various goods in the US goes for 100 dollars and that same basket of goods in Vietnam goes for 10 dollars (ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL), then a fair exchange rate would be 10 dong for one dollar. This is one way that these are calculated—people look at prices for similar goods, adjust for import and other costs, and determine how much that currency can actually purchase. When a country sets their own exchange rate, even if partially like in china’s case, it’s possible to undervalue it. They have an incentive to claim that their currency is weaker than it actually is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, no, that simply isn’t true. I know what you’re trying to say—fiat money has no intrinsic value—but it doesn’t mean that it can’t be undervalued or overvalued relative to other currencies. There’s a reason why economists or even someone casually interested in the economy and trade policy use these terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875322&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875149&lt;br&gt;Reparations absolutely traumatized Germans in terms of their willingness to take on debt lol. They’ll have to do some serious heavy lifting in the EU soon, so I imagine they’ll start taking some more on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875497&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875322&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s already happened, they got rid of the limit and are doomping into their infrastructure and military&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873712&lt;br&gt;kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875517&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874965&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;How do you think they have such a ridiculous surplus?&lt;br&gt;by being better than others at everything that matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875527&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LMAO. Expecting Chinese to stop subsidising their industry is akin to asking Americans to stop eating Burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875528&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875497&lt;br&gt;Huh no kidding, I hadn’t been paying much attention to that. One thing I will be keeping an eye on is the EU pension crisis and how that’s managed because I personally don’t see a smooth exit from that situation, especially in France. Looking into it, I guess Germany has a similar problem, which I wouldn’t have guessed based on their debt. What’s your take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875121&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s between 6 and 8 Yuan so it&amp;#x27;s still tied to the dollar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875517&lt;br&gt;Well, my point was that by managing the currency in order to keep it low, it makes exports more attractive, which results in a huge surplus. If the yuan floated freely, this would eventually correct. A huge trade surplus would mean more demand for the yuan and it would strengthen the currency. However, China doesn’t let this happen. If the currency strengthens or threatens to strengthen beyond what they deem desirable, they weaken their currency by selling yuan or by setting a lower daily exchange rate. This is the advantage of a managed currency, but it also means that it pisses everyone off when their own exports aren’t as competitive or their domestic industries suffer. China claims that they don’t this to the extent that they’re accused of, and it definitely comes in waves of egregiousness, but it seems like they’re back at it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, it’s true they’re good at exporting, but their insane trade surplus is in part the result of what I’m describing (an undervalued yuan that is kept undervalued by china’s central bank).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875564&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873590&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;call western &amp;quot;social democracies&amp;quot; capitalist&lt;br&gt;We are 10 times more communist than china... with an extra helping of suicidal democracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875527&lt;br&gt;China doesn&amp;#x27;t subsidize their industries though&lt;br&gt;They just do things better and have more affordable standards of living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875583&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873819&lt;br&gt;Wtf I love China now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875617&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875554&lt;br&gt;It can be undervalued and tied to the dollar. Read my post. You seem to think that because a currency’s exchange rate hasn’t changed that it can’t be undervalued or overvalued. That’s not true. Its real value in terms of purchasing power could rise and the central bank could artificially exert downward pressure (which would mean that the exchange rate would stay roughly the same over time). This is exactly what China has been accused of forever, and the issue is that China issue exactly forthcoming with their economic data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is obviously tied to the dollar. It is not STRICTLY PEGGED to the dollar. Every day the PBOC sets the exchange rate. The argument is that this rate hasn’t changed and has remained too low for how much demand there is for the yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875625&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875528&lt;br&gt;Well they&amp;#x27;re definitely going to bail the pension system out, but it should be kind of mitigated by the military and infrastructure spending because of their domestic industry. Adding money to those sectors should hypothetically cause more younger people to make more money, increasing direct contributions to the pension system. The bet that they&amp;#x27;re taking is that the spending won&amp;#x27;t increase inflation as much as it will improve the economic situation, which has some merit because Germany and even the rest of the EU have considerably lower debt to GDP than China or the US, and the currency has been appreciating broadly over the past few years giving them room for increased spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875629&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875572&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of them are subsidised. They do not call them as subsidies but different names. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: Ran a Business sourcing products from multiple suppliers in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875657&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873690&lt;br&gt;A communist dictator that values his people and his country will absolutely make any system built on jewish corruption look bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875675&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875625&lt;br&gt;Interesting, good take. Definitely a situation to watch, particularly how the bailout happens. Getting a handle on youth unemployment, especially in France, should help, yeah. Realistically, I wonder if the pension system will be continued for much longer moving forward, and I think the French will lose their shit if it’s reformed in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;China now rises to take the world stage because the west was reckless and retarded with their wealth. They relied on Chinas cheap exports too much and now suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876792&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875124&lt;br&gt;Yes, the pride comes before the fall. As it always has throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875563&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an interesting theory that borders on coping strategy because it makes currency seem much more important than the worthless shit it is. Yuan floating or not floating does not change the fact that China manufactures everything that&amp;#x27;s not manufactured elsewhere. The currency that is used in the exchange of goods does not change that fact. The unfloating of yuan would not teleport all the CNC mills, supply chains, and millions of workers into Tennessee or Germany. Currency can ligma balls or be infinitely expensive compared to other currencies, it does not matter. It may seem that it does, but it does not. Fixed currency makes exchange of goods easier, and manufacturers can plan more easily. Exchange rates are annoying, that&amp;#x27;s true. China eliminated that headache. It&amp;#x27;s a right decision, but nowhere near the most important decision they made to be the best at everything that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876956&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874655&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the US can literally print the oil price into the ground&lt;br&gt;it can&amp;#x27;t actually. Picrel. Being able to produce 70% of the all physical things on Earth give you the ability to print whatever you want WITHOUT inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876956&lt;br&gt;midwit take. they avoid inflation by having an iron grip on capital flows. they essentially cheat the impossible trinity model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>why would anyone live here — 77 replies — 308.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797?lm=1771561475</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:24:35 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;why would anyone live here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 77 • Updated: 2026-02-20 04:24 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;i recently moved to NYC to work for a &amp;quot;lucrative salary&amp;quot; (not really, because this place drains you of all your income) and after working here for 4 months i dont know why anyone would willingly live here&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the entire city smells like rotting shit, cigarette buds and dead animals, not a faint smell, an extremely strong odor that you&amp;#x27;ll eventually just become nose blind to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;homeless people, fucking everywhere, when i left my apartment there were homeless people sleeping in the hallways of my complex, when you go on walk there are homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk with a PILLOW and BLANKET while regular people walk over them like this is just some normal fucking occurrence (and in this shithole it is) never ever have i seen some shit like this even in the worst of cities ive lived in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;heroin needles, weed bags, cigarette buds &amp;amp; the occasional dildo just scattered across the city sidewalks, your constantly walking over human shit, broken bottles or dime bags&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rats and rodents EVERYWHERE. il never forget the time i bought a pizza from one of the disgusting street vendors and when i sat down at a table one of the rats were circling my feet trying to climb my leg for a bite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the &amp;quot;public transport&amp;quot; system is a just permanent housing for the mentally ill, every time i had to ride the subway i was scared for my life because of all the fucking looneys that inhabit the train systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is just off the top of my head, but i think the biggest mindfuck of it all is that its EXPENSIVE to live here its gonna cost you not 50k, not 100k, not 200k, to live comfortably by yourself you need 250K yearly in manhattan. 250k, to live among violent homeless people, 250k to constantly have to walk in rotting shit and roadkill. 250k to have your ears blown out by car horns &amp;amp; niggerbabble, 250k to be forced to smell the most putried scents imaginable i dont know why anyone sane would live here, this place is some sort of social experiment, some sort of anonmoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Go back to your trailer park, pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872853&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;You know the phrase &amp;quot;If you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re not making it.

Do they just stay in their small private rich people cuck zones and take the cab everywhere? Why would anyone want to live like that? Why live in a city if you can only actually inhabit small parts of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874993&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872905&lt;br&gt;Yeah seeing kids just walking around amids the violent homeless was crazy.

I am also a newly graduated psychiatric nurse practitioner. I was about to start an NP job with a guaranteed salary of 150k with good benefits and a decent RVU bonus (bonuses for how many patients I see). However, this job has incredibly shady business practices, terrible reviews from former employees and was far away from home. The job was in a northern suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. It was three 12 hour shifts in a row without a lunch break. I was supposed to start in early April.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I resigned last night in favor of a job close to family in a rural area in the southeast USA. This job pays me a 6,000$ a month draw and 67% of my collections. After I pay off the draw in a few months I could make as much money as I want, but that is contingent on the amount of patients I see. I can work as much or as little as I want. Take as much lunch break as I want. Benefits are offered W-2, but the health insurance is expensive. Here I will be doing real psychiatry and not corporate slop crap psychiatry. Also, my family is very happy about me staying close to home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically I am trading certain money at a shit job for uncertain money (albeit a higher ceiling) at a good job. I talked to one of the NPs at the new place and he says that he makes about 24,000$ a month before taxes after working for 5 years. This would be almost double what I would have made in Frisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you think I made the right choice? Would you have done the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875728&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;so you took a better job, for higher pay, to live in a lower cost of living area with more flexibility and closer to family?&lt;br&gt;wow, just wow anon. you fucked up big&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875759&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows because every fag online claims he makes 300k a year now. No one knows what a good job is anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875728&lt;br&gt;True, but there is a worst case scenario where I am getting almost no patients and stuck in the draw for much longer than anticipated. Although if I work 5-6 days a week I doubt this will happen. Also, If I somehow get fired while still paying the draw I have to pay it all off in 10 days, which would be nightmare scenario. There is more risk with the good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875905&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875878&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no patients&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in rural shartmerica&lt;br&gt;you will be overloaded with obese diabetic fentanyl-addicted burgeoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875905&lt;br&gt;Well I sure hope so. Thanks for reassuring me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876406&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875905&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876376&lt;br&gt;shit just load up on chinese semiglutide and you are in bussiness for life my friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876602&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;without a lunch break&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s illegal in all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876683&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;No, I would have done the exact opposite of what you did.&lt;br&gt;I think you fucked it all up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876776&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876602&lt;br&gt;Employers in Texas are not required to provide breaks of any kind. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876683&lt;br&gt;How so? Why do you think I fucked it all up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876894&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876406&lt;br&gt;Lmao I am not that kind of NP but apparently you can make bank doing weight loss stuff, and sometimes they will even hire psych nurse practitioners for that. Not my cup of tea tho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876905&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;You dodged a bullet, OP. The little town of Frisco apparently has a data center going in nearby, and guess what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876923&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876905&lt;br&gt;Yeah when I was checking out some elementary schools in the Frisco area for my kids some schools were literally like 80% indian demographics and there is indian food and indian shops everywhere in town. I would much prefer to live in small town America as opposed to little Hyderabad with a HCOL as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876945&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875715&lt;br&gt;You made a good decision running away from 3 consecutive 12 hour shifts with no lunch. You made a bad decision accepting or even applying for a job that uses a draw. Draw sucks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876967&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876945&lt;br&gt;Yeah draw sucks but I have 50k in savings and 30k in retirement. I can easily do a 6,000$ draw for up to a year. The NP I talked to said he had his draw payed off in 4 months. Shit, I only make about 6,000$ a month as a nurse so its not any difference anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>BTC dumping? Don’t care.

The TVL speaks for itself.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873663&lt;br&gt;Better than letting your BTC sit there doing absolutely nothing while you pretend that’s some high IQ strategy lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874904&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you only get 0,04% yield on bitcoin if you dont have any Baby token?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876341&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869502&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#x27;s wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876854&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873735&lt;br&gt;So where are we going to put my 12btc?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876858&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873657&lt;br&gt;They&amp;#x27;re not bots.

He is actually a principled man and doesn’t wanna get compromised by Jewish sexpest glowniggers. Turns out he really is the biggest brain in crypto and he won’t be doing anything with BAT until all these disgusting uncouth kikes are long gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876038&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876025&lt;br&gt;Trvth Svpernova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876042&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876025&lt;br&gt;Wait this ain&amp;#x27;t a nvke how are you defending a guy for being in the files. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yikes that&amp;#x27;s a bad look sweetie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876043&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875982&lt;br&gt;Jeets will watch SAR, very good customers who doing the needful, please understand sar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876047&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember when baggies used to pay you money to use Brave?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can use a dogshit browser with barely-functioning adblocker and MAKE money oh boy im sure this isnt a scam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876088&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876042&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;how are you defending a guy for being in the files.&lt;br&gt;They couldn’t get him on the island.

Seriously you can&amp;#x27;t ask for a raise and give me one of your jobs? Then you mock me for failing to get a job? You are hogging 2 jobs. If you didn&amp;#x27;t work 2 jobs there would be room for unemployed people to have jobs too. Boomer X fuckers still don&amp;#x27;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake and Gay Economy — 44 replies — 14.5/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520?lm=1771550794</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 01:26:34 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Fake and Gay Economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 44 • Updated: 2026-02-20 01:26 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will this gay as economy finally collapse and how can i profit from it?&lt;br&gt;Its ridiculous the woman at our workplace contribute nothing to the company and make more money than i do&lt;br&gt;Its infuriating we just had a bunch of lay offs and we lost some of oir best workers but somehow a bunch of HR shits who do nothing all day still work here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HR is a necessary function, chud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871530&lt;br&gt;For what?&lt;br&gt;Genuinely why do we need it to this extent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Protect the corp from lawsuits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;This is a fiat problem, not a capitalism problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872170&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;The purpose of HR is to protect the company. Putting a retarded and narcisstic Stacy in and having her railroad, gaslight, and demoralize employees, is her primary objective. Think of it as internal forced arbitration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872188&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872072&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ai will replace the hr roastie&lt;br&gt;yes&lt;br&gt;but then she will just be hired to do something even more worthless&lt;br&gt;that will pay even more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872195&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s because they decide whom to fire. Make the lists, at least, which then get approved without looking. Do you think they&amp;#x27;d put themselves on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872202&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;For once, all of picrelated feet don&amp;#x27;t look like they smell so good. God I hate HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872233&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;capitalist&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;where the corporations control the government&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and steal all the the money via bail outs and money printing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thats not capitalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872278&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Government prints money to give it corporations so they can just give it to each other in a circle to make number go up&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Corporations just use that imaginary money to buy back their own stocks to artificially make number go up&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;80 billion dollars given to Israel so all Israeli citizens are guaranteed healthcare and higher education and six figure stipends while you are denied this in your own country&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Capitalism&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872395&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872072&lt;br&gt;You couldn&amp;#x27;t be more wrong. HR stands for HUMAN relations.

I instantly know there is a schizo take coming when i read this. Some schizo takes are interesting, some are even good, some are good to think through and some are just funny to read. But they stzill are schizo takes and mostly bullshit influeces too much by wish bias. So how and where did this phrase pick up with schizos. When i know, its around 2021/2022 when the schizo&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;economy will collapse and people will starve due to lockdowns&lt;br&gt;did not materialize. Then they started with this phrase to somehow save their prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873806&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no less than three seething replies about muh real capitalism&lt;br&gt;If you abolished the state it would be reinvented by the wealthy overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;Fake and gay was in use when I 1st started using this site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873988&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Hopefully never because I have a fake overpaid job, just not in HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876439&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872064&lt;br&gt;And prevent White women from breeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Me do asset management &amp; financial planning for a living AMAA — 52 replies — 14.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872433</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872433?lm=1771548764</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 00:52:44 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Me do asset management &amp;amp; financial planning for a living AMAA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872433'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 52 • Updated: 2026-02-20 00:52 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me do asset management &amp;amp; financial planning for a living AMAA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872440&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Looks boring af.

I’m thinking of a split between SPYI, QQQI, O, and SCHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872526&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;US market has had a good run for about 15 years, but that doesn&amp;#x27;t mean it will continue to. Foreign stocks are beating the everloving fuck out of US stocks this year so for for example.&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s why he said global ETF&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;honestly abusing correlation seems only worth it if the assets have an equal return to stocks, all this junk has such low return even if its negatively correlated you&amp;#x27;re not going to get a free reduction in variance with it without killing your return. That&amp;#x27;s why i heard some paper showed its optimal to just go 100% stocks. Even if your a boomer, bonds aren&amp;#x27;t really worth it, you can just adjust your spending if theres a downturn and still come out ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying to finds stocks/etfs that are weakly correlated seems to be the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872998&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872888&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of assets that meet or beat equity markets with CAGR and are low correlation. Some are right in the data here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872698&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gold for example has a higher average annual return, better risk adjusted return, and a 0.1 correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;All on btc shorts. Outperform those gay indexes for the next three years in one week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;Why do you focus on yield so much instead of total returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a lot of US large cap equity exposure with tax inefficiency if it&amp;#x27;s in a taxable account. You&amp;#x27;ll get big dividend though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like PTY, ASGI, etc for yield personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873145&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872998&lt;br&gt;no it fucking doesn&amp;#x27;t, in the last 110 years it has returned 5% while the stock market returned 10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873145&lt;br&gt;ik this is probably bait but that&amp;#x27;s a very silly time period to look at because before we got off the gold standard it was fixed ounces/USD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaning 0% growth for half that period dragging the CAGR way down lol. Doesn&amp;#x27;t make sense to look at the return pre Nixon shock for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;if you like uncorrelated risk adjusted-returns you should look at alternative investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;Returns are totally dependent on the managers imho, it&amp;#x27;s a cool class. I&amp;#x27;m not a huge fan of the illiquidity personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do like some of them them, especially private farmland/timberland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not a huge fan of venture or growth PE, guess I&amp;#x27;m lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873207&lt;br&gt;have you looked into managed futures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873080&lt;br&gt;I use my brokerage as my main savings account. Instead of getting $500/month in a high yield savings account I rather get $1400, 50-75% I could reinvest. But since you do this for a living I&amp;#x27;m going to listen and allocate more money for growth rather than yield going forward, and you&amp;#x27;re right about the taxes, I didn&amp;#x27;t think too much about that. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873214&lt;br&gt;I cant believe I forgot about those!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use the ETFs for simplicity. ISMF/CTA for crisis alpha. I almost went DBMF too, but I prefer the purer systematic trend heavy ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you have any strong opinions on them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like extreme negative correlation, like -0.4 with 6-8% CAGR which is completely acceptable if you&amp;#x27;re rebalancing with a really aggressive equity portfolio. I considered pairing them with TQQQ or SOXL to be a total jackass at once point and pussed out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873231&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873220&lt;br&gt;You accept more risk (volatility) for those higher returns, that&amp;#x27;s the tradeoff. If you are OK with higher risk then you could always choose one of those balanced allocation funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOR for example just rebalances a 60% stock / 40% bond index portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOA does the same thing but 80% stock (more risk)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These really are the easy button for people that don&amp;#x27;t want to self-manage imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably a good idea to put the portion that&amp;#x27;s your emergency fund into something boring and very lowvol but decent yield. Check out JPST, that might be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873222&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;those are the returns for my managed futures program, im a CTA. its great uncorrelated returns but theres a lot of programs that under perform or blow up (-60%+ years). its definitely more liquid than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873270&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873256&lt;br&gt;Damn dude you&amp;#x27;re crushing it. What&amp;#x27;s the time period on those returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind if I ask what your strategy is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any specific managed futures ETFs you like? Are they even close to replicating the actuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873270&lt;br&gt;thats 20 months of performance trading 8 different futures markets. semi-systematic medium frequency trend following. im not too familiar with the ETFs that track managed futures but they usually focus on the billion dollar CTAs and those programs are lower returns lower risk just trying to be uncorrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873448&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873184&lt;br&gt;ok, its still not beating the stock market unlike your claim, and if you take the last 3 years out and it drops a lot. That is insane volatility that it doesn&amp;#x27;t converge after 50 years. Realistically the actual return is maybe 7% and you get very long periods of dogshit ~3%, and for all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m currently halfway through finishing my CFP course&lt;br&gt;Any advice for someone trying to hit the ground running, beyond spamming LinkedIn? Or should I just accept that this job market is going to rape me until I give up hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Cant ai just do most of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;This. Almost tooka financial advisor job. Then I realized, &amp;quot;why the fuck would anybody talk to a human about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Cause the AI will tell you something plausible that it thinks you want to hear, and it will partially or mostly hallucinate the data it uses to deliver that response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Do you hold any bitcoin? What are your thoughts on it and does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874040&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872561&lt;br&gt;I am a europoor(in a very poor country) so I dont think i have access to most the stuff you are listing. I can only buy ETFs, I have most my portfolio in a Global market cap ETF some in europe ETF and a little in small cap value international and emerging markets. Also bought a sizable stack of silver sub 30 dollars but its going to be a bitch to sell. I dont invest in bonds since I think that every government will just keep on printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874046&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873450&lt;br&gt;Connections are everything, and the exam will be easier than you think. The classes were hugely valuable, were harder and more useful than my master&amp;#x27;s degree courses. Most companies will have you try to peddle shit insurance products to friends/family at the entry level it&amp;#x27;s gross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Maybe someday, not right now. For what &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873827 said and because it just sucks at answering niche or complex questions. When I ask it things it usually feeds me flat out wrong answers that would be passable to someone that didn&amp;#x27;t do any research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example is having it try to pick stocks. Gets obliterated by the index funds every time. It&amp;#x27;s a consistent loser at this because it can&amp;#x27;t make forward projections and the question is too complicated for it. Tax questions are a horror show too, you&amp;#x27;d think it would be good at those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main issue with AI in my eyes is that it just doesn&amp;#x27;t understand humans/human nature. Most of my job is behavioral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;I do, I made a bunch of money in it 2016ish and now build and rebalance a position in my retirement accounts (5-10% allocation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874061&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874040&lt;br&gt;Wish I knew more about EU investing, I&amp;#x27;m completely specialized for US investing so it&amp;#x27;s out of my wheelhouse. I only have a handful of expat/foreign clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EU bonds have been zero or even negative for a long time. I won&amp;#x27;t touch them because they don&amp;#x27;t compensate you for loaning them money, and I can&amp;#x27;t believe people keep buying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently it has something to do with their SIPC insurance equivalent, safer park for cash than a checking account basically because of the federal coverage you get by buying a bond. I haven&amp;#x27;t looked much into it just what I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgot to answer this part. We don&amp;#x27;t buy it in our portfolios, but we do help clients manage the risk associated with it. Some people are believers in crypto so we highlight the risks (volatility, no intrinsic value, etc) and then work with them to figure out how much of their overall investments is a prudent amount to put into that risk asset. I personally cap myself at 10% for both gold and crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto is actually considered speculation instead of investing by most managers. Kind of like commodities/gold/NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874261&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873448&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;its still not beating the stock market &lt;br&gt;It does in the 26-year backward looking period in the data array from the picture by 30bp. Instead of just pulling 7% out of your booty you could spend 10 seconds doing the present value calculation if you really wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s about 9.8% annualized if you go all the way back to &amp;#x27;71 from now ($39-$5,000). That&amp;#x27;s definitely nothing to scoff at when constructing a portfolio and hedging equity markets considering the 0.1 correlation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;That is insane volatility&lt;br&gt;Volatility is good in a portfolio of non-correlated assets that&amp;#x27;s rebalanced outside of tolerance bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market&lt;br&gt;Almost keeps up with it and doesn&amp;#x27;t move in the same direction, which is the idea. Non-correlated assets, rebalancing the volatility, and risk-return tradeoff are portfolio construction 101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874286&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright anon, I&amp;#x27;m out. Have a great day and I hope every one of you gets to retire early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS long nursing homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874295&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Is there a gap in the asset management &amp;amp; financial planning software market? Seems you are just using an excel sheet there. Is there any way your life could be easier or more automated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a developer and I like money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874345&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874295&lt;br&gt;The software is pretty comprehensive and generally way deeper than just an excel sheet, but of course there&amp;#x27;s an industry spectrum of how deep/detailed the analysis goes by firm and by program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some is straight up basically a cash flows projection laid on top of a balance sheet (excel). The people that use this are shitty whole life insurance people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the auxiliary software where the money is at right now it seems. AI that reads trusts using OCR and spits out a summary to help you find issues. Tax software. Stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our software for portfolio management (have used 3) is AWFUL though. That&amp;#x27;s a big gap for asset management imho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876336&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874261&lt;br&gt;Im sorry but your sample size is not big enough. The volatility and nature of the distribution of gold prices (its not normally distributed) means you have to be very careful about inferring information about long term returns. For example if you look at gold as an asset just 5 years ago you get very different conclusions. &lt;br&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo If the data changes heavily based on the precise dates or periods that you choose it indicates it hasn&amp;#x27;t converged to an acceptable error margin yet. 7% is a guess at what an average random sample period would be given that they can range from ~3% to ~9% or w/e but idk, im not gonna do your job for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simple sanity check should tell you that an asset that doesn&amp;#x27;t produce or do much of anything shouldn&amp;#x27;t outperform real cash generating businesses and companies in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us? — 79 replies — 13.7/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796?lm=1771540972</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 22:42:52 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 79 • Updated: 2026-02-19 22:42 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys in the EU make less than us on paychecks, but you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare and PTO while we have to pay for private insurance which chronically denies people&amp;#x27;s health situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are people saying that starting a business in the EU is difficult because of the regulations? What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends enormously on which country are we talking about. Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870682&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870203&lt;br&gt;ah, i see, you are retarded. just because some laws that are lax exist doesn&amp;#x27;t mean data is protected, you fucking retarded faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870744&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870065&lt;br&gt;it started long before post-WW2 tho, germs bureaucracymaxxed post-reunification during the 2nd Reich, from 1871 onward.&lt;br&gt;At first it was to keep in check all the landers trying to take the lion&amp;#x27;s share of federal credits and centralize power. And it worked gud, but then it progressively became the hellscape kafkaian machine we all know.&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s how you know the hallofcost never happened, becuz you can be sure nazis would have made endless paperworks addressing the situation, down to the very last jewish pubic hair, but we didn&amp;#x27;t find any document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop eating the commie propaganda. Europeans don&amp;#x27;t have savings for shit, they just have stable expenses but all their wealth is tied to inheriting homes. That&amp;#x27;s why homes are basically untaxed while stocks are treated like financial Nazism. You aren&amp;#x27;t going to spend more a healthy young person in the US, the real benefit of Europe is the private healthcare is very cheap and good &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting businesses in Europe sucks because of two factors. The first is low liquidity and consumer spending: unlike the US, people don&amp;#x27;t spend nearly as much, have as much to spend, or make debt. So there isn&amp;#x27;t much room for anyone to buy something new - successful businesses target liquid tourists or B2B, where they write off the huge taxes as expenses. Over regulated financial market also leads to lower liquidity and more difficulty getting loans and investors, you rely on government programs run by middle aged menopausal cunts that have never worked more than 28 hours a week &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other issue is labor laws and public perception. It&amp;#x27;s morally bankrupt to try and get more money, why aren&amp;#x27;t you happy being average, why are you trying to pull ahead. Anyone you hire can&amp;#x27;t be fired, you can&amp;#x27;t have low compensation with offset packages to get high skill labor, you need to suck some blue blooded cock to get money and not wait years for whatever permits you&amp;#x27;ll need, because they were born out of nobility and still have half the money and connections &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eurotards freak out about Epstein but every European politician and rich person rapes babies for breakfast. It&amp;#x27;s just 1) not pedo to them if they&amp;#x27;re over 14 bc muh age of consent and 2) they hide in the shadows unlike Americans, they try to be as unnoticed as possible, give a few concessions to the poor and continue ruling sucking and fucking like they&amp;#x27;ve been doing the past thousand years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870889&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870103&lt;br&gt;What are the reforms that boomers are blocking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870915&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869942&lt;br&gt;Yeah i feel the same. Sex, drugs and love are already the ultimate sensations and none of them are expensive. All luxuries are pretty worthless add-ons and don’t feel special. You just have a bigger bed, or a bigger car, not anything you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870937&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s complete bullshit, stop making up fantasies in your mind. If there is ONE thing still somewhat running smoothly in western Europe, it&amp;#x27;s free healthcare.&lt;br&gt;Contrary to you i know what i&amp;#x27;m talking about since i was on the operation table just a month ago to fix few lower vertebrae after a bike accident. I never had to wait for anything more than few days, nor did i have to spend a single penny on pre-procedures, examinations or for the hospital stay/operation/anesthesia/post-op medication. And i don&amp;#x27;t have any health mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It probably would have costed me a bazillion goybux in the jewSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870937&lt;br&gt;Why the fuck would it cost bajillions, even shit insurance has a max out of pocket of like 10k. If you don&amp;#x27;t have a job medicaid literally covers everything for free, the real problem is half the people that qualify are too fucking stupid to sign up for it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also if the accident wasn&amp;#x27;t your fault you could sue for big money, in Europe they&amp;#x27;re just like meh accidents happen enjoy the lifelong complications faggot. I will agree southern European health systems are pretty decent and their private healthcare is fantastic and cheap, but if you&amp;#x27;re German or some shit I&amp;#x27;d rather have the US system, you guys pay more in healthcare tax than any American if you have a half decent job and if you get anything where you may actually die they just say, yeah you&amp;#x27;re fucked settle your affairs or the bureaucracy will give the rest of your family a stroke, no point trying any more it&amp;#x27;s an inefficient allocation of resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;This is extremely short-sighted of them, they will end up losing the capacity to compete and fall behind slowly, they actually already are, then when they slowly go on closing business left and right from ever increasing ineficiency. What else can they even do but borrow more and more for the worst possible spending a state can do, paying bills, a budget blackhole, increasing inflation and making money useless and as those countries get poorer the services will also get far far far worse and extremely corrupt, not even talking about how such aging will make it even worse. Honestly this is reading like what happened to argentina, greece and other latam and thirdies socialist govts did, it will work fine as long as the economy can keep it, when it starts to shrink it will be poverty hell. I will agree that america treats us workers pretty bad, but this welfare paradise of the EU won&amp;#x27;t work for long either, they will end up forced to cut things and get closer to us if they want to survive a world with China, India, US and former colonies being no longer mudhutts but mildly developed enough to make raw resources more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Lots of retards ITT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Setting up a business is child&amp;#x27;s play in places like Denmark, Sweden, Estonia. Setting up, doing tax returns and all interactions with gov is handled through online ID and takes seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Places like Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia are selling themselves as business friendly. Very low taxes. Some places like Bulgaria have extremely low dividend taxes so you pay yourself with dividends. Romania has a corporate setup where you pay a tiny percentage on the turnover. Ideal for freelancers or small business with high margins or just extreme low expense. In all of these places, corporate setups and accountants cost next to nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you have some almost offshore jurisdictions still in the EU with insanely beneficial rules for some niches and very low taxes. Like Cyprus and Malta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now regulations, what regulations? Anything (except guns, booze, some gambling, cigarettes I guess) is traded freely between the states under the same legislation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also: we get sued way less over here. Do the math on that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871050&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; wife started selling her paintings&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; she declared herself first, this was needed to attend some events&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; French government instantly asks her for €800, before she has made her first sale&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; this is what they estimate she&amp;#x27;d owe them at the end of the year based on their estimates of how much she will earn, so they ask for it upfront&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you can contest it but it&amp;#x27;s actually faster to wait for the year to end so they are proven wrong&lt;br&gt;I hate them so much...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871051&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;taxes&lt;br&gt;depends where, some places will legit rape your revenue&lt;br&gt;Combined with some insane regulations and you legit can&amp;#x27;t start a company&lt;br&gt;Best example is France, fucked up taxes, and if you want to get into tech, or anything that involves personal data, you need cough up 6 to 7 figures so that your cyber security is in the norm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;I will die long before I see some high tech company or even mid tier industry appear in latam, africa or even india, they will always be turning up cheap raw resources because they are simply brown subhumans with low iq, not even talking about russia post-war. Its an unfounded fearmongering that we will ever have to compete with them lol, you forget europe will never fall to thirdie level of mismanagement simple because we are better educated and white. At the very worst unlikely scenario we will always make money from tourism anyway, but honestly this is all american envy for no reason, we are not stopping you from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871116&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871023&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re admitting you can only live off arbitrage? Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria, Romania is actually marginally based because it&amp;#x27;s spread its asshole to US companies for cheap EU labor, those Nordic countries you listed have a smaller economy than Pennsylvania so yeah if you want to sell troon support stickers you&amp;#x27;re good but you&amp;#x27;re not going to make shit otherwise &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portugal is also kind of based but it fully relies on US and other European investments, as well as inexistent enforcement of labor laws and pathetic salaries. I don&amp;#x27;t get how you&amp;#x27;d start up there without the first 100k being gifted though, or the family having land, or working abroad first &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire opening a bakery or car wash or hamster fentanyl university of arts like the US, there&amp;#x27;s no consumer spending to eat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871180&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire&lt;br&gt;Lmao, just look at economic charts, most european economies have high tech industry as the main economic activity, american bullshit as usual, nobody needs to be a millionaire in europe, we already live better than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria,&lt;br&gt;As I said, you are a fucking retard. Your company is in Bulgaria, but you sell to fucking anyone in EU the same way while paying insanely low corporate tax and next to no admin fees. You ship from anywhere you want in the EU, or have staff in bloody Manila if you wish. What the fuck does that have to do with arbitrage? You incorporate wherever you want since it is your legal right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doubt you are entrepreneurial material though, so do not bother grokking the potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871000&lt;br&gt;The suing thing is the biggest AIDS of USA. People are already well compensated enough in europe for their troubles. The ”if you make a honest mistake, someone will see their opportinity and sue you and financially destroy your life” mentality just creates even more stress to an already high stress environment of USA. It just makes people act even more legally defensive at every turn and creates useless bureucracy and slows things down. Getting raped when everything didn’t go 100% nicely is not something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;This is the most midwit take and the reason why USA is failing now (it has become a nation of midwits due to poor public education). People have been saying this for decades but right now europe is in a bullrun while USA has been becoming an oligarchic brasil since the 80s. Clearly socialism doesn&amp;#x27;t just lead to inefficiency but instead to more efficiency for all instead of just few hoarding the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871353&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871183&lt;br&gt;Learn to read Fritz, you are saying what I&amp;#x27;m saying while sounding like a mong. You&amp;#x27;re setting up in poor countries to sell to richer countries&amp;#x27; businesses while using the common market, it&amp;#x27;s geographic arbitrage you sausage guzzling troon, and you&amp;#x27;re selling to businesses. All that free education and you&amp;#x27;re still poorer than a fucking car salesman in Pensacola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871500&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871214&lt;br&gt;What? Excluding Pooland all major eu economies have stopped growing or deacelerated fast, people were saying it for decades with reason, if it wasnt for a miraculous fall of the ussr and a flood of cheap raw resources and energy with negligible transport costs from russia it would&amp;#x27;ve happened earlier as it did post-2008 when europe started to lag more and more behind the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867554&lt;br&gt;Nigger&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;give us taxes goy&lt;br&gt;ok, well, how much&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;We don&amp;#x27;t know uwu&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you tell us&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but if you&amp;#x27;re wrong we get to take even more of your money lol&lt;br&gt;you just said you don&amp;#x27;t know what I owe&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thats right &lt;br&gt;so how do you know if I pay wrong?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Don&amp;#x27;t get cheeky with us you little shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871570&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871500&lt;br&gt;That guy is fucking retarded why even argue. The average European is still a moron, printing useless degrees doesn&amp;#x27;t make people smarter. They still cuck themselves daily. He&amp;#x27;s happy to never own anything so his blue blooded friends can hoard the land and wealth like they&amp;#x27;ve always done &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Muh healthcare muh taxes &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half of every country is too fucking poor to pay tax, and the top 10% isn&amp;#x27;t stupid enough to pay tax, so the middle class just pays 50% of their income while being happy they can rent a shit hole for life and that they&amp;#x27;re better off unemployed than working in terms of life quality &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will definitely return to Europe once my nest egg is built, I&amp;#x27;ll just live in 2 different countries 179 days a year and live off US divvies therefore paying no retard tax and just paying private healthcare out of pocket, or if I really make it just pay the flat 100k Italian tax and get private insurance for 300 a month that will pay for top quality coverage while I sip Italian wines and hire high end eastern european hookers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871624&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871570&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can’t get women otherwise so has to pay for hookers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for revealing that you’re some dysfunctional weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871681&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871624&lt;br&gt;Thanks for showing why you&amp;#x27;re weak, religious morals won&amp;#x27;t get you anywhere. Also very europilled, way more Europeans use hookers than Americans outside the lower class - but you pretend like it&amp;#x27;s somehow weird while you haven&amp;#x27;t even been to church since your communion &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now I bang for free, outside working and life only about one chick a week, but you bet your ass I&amp;#x27;ll buy some dimes when I can live off passive income, at least they&amp;#x27;re safe and making good money unlike the daughters you gave away to arabs to be beaten and bred to show how woke you are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871776&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many countries are gatekept by language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;People are doing a lot of grifting and lobby work for deregulation. Starting a business isn&amp;#x27;t really difficult.&lt;br&gt;There are some bad things, in Germany for example financing rounds require a notary to read out the whole contract in person to you. But a lot of these things you and 90% of small business owners won&amp;#x27;t encounter in practice&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;You legitimately think accountants only exist in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868110&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not bullshit. Europeans are smart. The European rich just refused to pay programmers so any good programmer went to America over the past 35 fucking years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am right now in the middle of an administrative process in spain which through no error on my side has taken a cumulative 60 - 70 legal work hours to solve for a license for a business unit that generates 15k € in revenue per annum &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;you tell me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871776&lt;br&gt;Shouldn&amp;#x27;t you be good if you speak English and French?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876041&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol. Lmao.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine not living in an offshore tax haven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have roads with no potholes and public schools. Hospitals. Low crime and comfy prisons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matter of fact, what do you mainlanders get for your tax burden? Other than replacement migration, high crime and crumbling public infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I have recently discovered leftwing finance youtube channels The whole things is never EVER blaming people for going int… — 38 replies — 13.6/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872693</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872693?lm=1771551703</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 01:41:43 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;I have recently discovered leftwing finance youtube channels The whole things is never EVER blaming people for going int…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872693'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 38 • Updated: 2026-02-20 01:41 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered leftwing finance youtube channels &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole things is never EVER blaming people for going into debt, but blaming companies instead&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Asking people how much debt they are in is Chud behaviour, just because they are in debt doesn&amp;#x27;t mean they can&amp;#x27;t go on a vacation, but Disneyland should be cheaper, Disney is predatory&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;The problem isn&amp;#x27;t credit card debt, that&amp;#x27;s normal, the problem is how hight the interests rates are&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;60k car loans are insane but really, why do the cars need to cost that much?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872704&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;The one you used in the OP got famous for calling people retards to their faces for their debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872721&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;Caleb is just a gay zoomer Dave Ramsey.

You fix a broken system by changing the system.

Which is why Henry Ford literally wrote a book about them. And the Dodge Brothers sued his ass because he was looking out for his employees not shareholders. You are so fucking stupid it hurts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873139&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872704&lt;br&gt;And as a result he became public enemy #1 among leftists. They literally call him a fascist for preaching financial responsibility, lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873140&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;create media product showcasing idiocy of goyim&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;get popular &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cash in &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;Or there&amp;#x27;s an issue in the educational system that produced several generations of financial illiterates that can&amp;#x27;t say no to thrice daily starbucks, avocado toast, $3k iphones, $90k trucks, and semiannual $20k vacations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874332&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873139&lt;br&gt;The leftoids want people to be poor because poor people vote for the leftoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874447&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;The problem IS how high interest rates are. People are fucking BNPLing consumer staples and groceries, no one owns anything and are using credit cards to pay bills. Caleb is not a leftist and OP is a massive faggot for defending usury which should be banned and its purveyors should be tried for treason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876211&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873117&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This is nigger logic and it almost never works out.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the only thing that works.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873133&lt;br&gt;How&amp;#x27;s Tel Aviv?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876215&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873914&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#x27;re saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice how individuals are considered the irresponsible ones, and not the governments that devalue the currency so that it&amp;#x27;s fucking worthless? Why doesn&amp;#x27;t (((Caleb))) talk about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876222&lt;br&gt;Or the institutions that charge usury-level interest, that&amp;#x27;s another point I should add&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873088&lt;br&gt;You, as an individual, will never, ever fix the system and the chances of a revolution sweeping along to do so, which by the way will just have some other bullshit attached, is slim to none and slim just left town. That leaves you alone, in the system, to &amp;quot;cope&amp;quot;. How will you do that? By reading the rules and bending them enough to make you prosperous within its confines. Everything else is a fuckkng pipe dream and you will just waste years toiling in it when you could have been making it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats what faggots who blame the system do. They give up. They dont have the fortitude. They dont put in &amp;quot;the hard work&amp;quot; to bend the rules and make them selves prosperous. They just drag everyone else down into thier level of misery out of envy. Dont be that fucking loser. Be the guy who makes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876247&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;Despite being a fat faggot, leftists hate Caleb Hammer for making the hateful claim that you shouldn&amp;#x27;t buy junk when you have to get a 150% APY loan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876259&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;retard takes a loan with 50% interest rate to buy some burritos at chipotle and labubus&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;completely oblivious about what loan interests means&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ITS NOT A BAD DECISION, ITS THE FAULT OF LE EVIL CAPITALISM&lt;br&gt;lmao holy fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876262&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876259&lt;br&gt;You shouldn&amp;#x27;t even be able to take out a loan at 50% kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkw21YfvpBk&amp;amp;t=927s&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally ends with &amp;quot;ahhh cool story, stand against the wall....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876302&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;There isn’t a structural issue.

It&amp;#x27;s a scheme that allows elite whales to cash out at the top. Fed money goes to Blackrock who buys mstr bonds. Mstr buys Bitcoin OTC from those in &amp;#x27;the club&amp;#x27;&lt;br&gt;There wouldn&amp;#x27;t be enough liquidity otherwise. &lt;br&gt;Noone actually buys mstr it&amp;#x27;s just an Epstein type operation to move money around and the goyim are too dumb to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873851&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saylor is well paid to launder funds through his “Bitcoin” management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875118&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873812&lt;br&gt;If mstr defaulted on those bonds BlackRock is going to be the biggest loser then since &amp;quot;noone actually buys mstr&amp;quot;. But I guess it won&amp;#x27;t hurt BlackRock portofolio if it really dropped to that point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe ~5-10% of mstr shareholders are genuine retail traders I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875148&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873670&lt;br&gt;Why aren&amp;#x27;t those bitcoins in his cup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875157&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873658&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;Are the longs cheap or still way overbought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875172&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873658&lt;br&gt;LOL&lt;br&gt;X10 is sure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875219&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;why is the mNAV &amp;gt; 1.0 to begin with? shouldn&amp;#x27;t it be &amp;lt; 1.0 since their value is basically btc_holdings - debt_obligations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;I hope this faggot&amp;#x27;s bluff gets called so bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875246&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;Holy based cyber hornets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the best thing to happen to crypto.

Have you ever met an Asian with empathy or altruism? I just don’t think their brains are capable of much so we see them as something less. There’s a reason why the Asians have no soul joke seems to stick. I don’t know maybe some Asian American can explain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870027&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;The subconscious will to die, the death drive is always present to varying degrees.

How do the most expensive vehicles have the worst drivers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871805&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is it about motorcycles that inspire so much seethe? Is it because 4chuds are high inhib pussy incels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871884&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is in 2014, 2017, 2021 you could take 10,000 bucks and buy basically anything and a 10x was guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember taking 2021 for granted lol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2024 bull run saw an initial pump from alts from january to april and then htey just bled from april to september, then bled again from december to may, and from may 2025 to present the bulk of alts bled out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember seeing microstrategy and I was like &amp;quot;gonna buy that when bitcoin goes back to 50k&amp;quot;. Then I saw MSTX. Hell yeah, double your money for each MSTR move, and MSTR was double bitcoin. A run to 100k from 50k would be an easy 8x. And it was. But I sold before the election and fumbled it. The fumbler. It&amp;#x27;s easy to create a perfect plan in your mind, and watch it play out exactly as you said it would, but it takes a lot of conviction to not fuck it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now most markets are way up. 2026, 2022, 2018, midterm years have slow market growth. The time to buy it was 2023, the time to make it was 2024, the time to swap into alts like KTA and HYPE and AVANTIS was 2025. I called everything correctly but fucked up the one thing that mattered- buying, and holding to a 10x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871780&lt;br&gt;Boomers love driving big SUVs for some reason. Makes them &amp;quot;feel safe&amp;quot; or some shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872189&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Bug people, soulless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Because they are literally lower quality organisms. Same reason no one gives a fuck when you kill a fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873614&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863924&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I would just like to know if all that crap about satan, moloch worship, demons, etc., it&amp;#x27;s just like a game because they simply like to eat and torture babies or do those entities really exist.&lt;br&gt;Nah but they believe in it. Very powerful people ironically fear death a lot so they somehow believe this can save them from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873616&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864738&lt;br&gt;They fear China the most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873938&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;What a dumb retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873940&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868075&lt;br&gt;This was denied by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873942&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;He could have make it if he had better control of his brakes, I think he&amp;#x27;s one of these riders who only use the front brake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>&gt;max out your 401(k) employer match &gt;max out a Roth IRA &gt;have a reasonable amount of cash in savings for a rainy day &gt;do… — 15 replies — 6.3/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875968</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875968?lm=1771553109</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:05:09 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&amp;gt;max out your 401(k) employer match &amp;gt;max out a Roth IRA &amp;gt;have a reasonable amount of cash in savings for a rainy day &amp;gt;do…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875968'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 15 • Updated: 2026-02-20 02:05 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;max out your 401(k) employer match&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;max out a Roth IRA&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have a reasonable amount of cash in savings for a rainy day&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;don&amp;#x27;t make stupid decisions&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;retire as a millionaire&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s that easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875968&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;dude just wage slave for 40 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;die at 59&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;or have only 5-10 years to enjoy millions&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can only enjoy money when you cant move anymore&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;great deal anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875994&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I lost my virginity in 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875995&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Boomers sold their children and grandchildren into a life of immiserated slavery so they could spend their twilight years living in luxury. It&amp;#x27;s the reason the covid lockdowns happened. They were the only demographic at risk but they had no problem shutting society down and ruining the lives of the youth to prevent themselves from getting a bad cough. We live under boomer communism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876158&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875986&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s what my dad did, so now I get to enjoy his retirement instead. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876242&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875986&lt;br&gt;Truthnuke. The real blackpill is realizing if you&amp;#x27;re born working or middle class you will not work and save your way out towards a comfortable life until you are old, and even then, you gotta basically pray that a big unexpected money sink won&amp;#x27;t happen such as you or a close relative getting very sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your children MIGHT enjoy the fruits of your labor, and they&amp;#x27;ll do it off of your blood and sweat, and that&amp;#x27;s implying you&amp;#x27;re a high-ish IQ person who lands a good job AND invests money wisely over a time frame of 15+ years. Both conditions need to be met. But forget about &amp;quot;enjoying life&amp;quot; yourself unless you get very lucky. You don&amp;#x27;t enjoy shit when you&amp;#x27;re old. The big problem with getting hopeful about saving and investing is people thinking one day as a 50 year old is the same as one day as a 25 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875968&lt;br&gt;You should also put some extra money into that brokerage account. A million isn&amp;#x27;t what it&amp;#x27;s cracked up to be, and it&amp;#x27;ll be even less by the time you&amp;#x27;re 59 1/2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he isn&amp;#x27;t 100% in precious metals by now&lt;br&gt;NGMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876566&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876242&lt;br&gt;Life as a 50-year-old old is identical to 25 except for your have more appreciation for everything. In almost every instance it is better as a 50-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876566&lt;br&gt;walking corpse cope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876532&lt;br&gt;No one wants your rock unc, that shit needs jewish IOUs to function as a currency&lt;br&gt;Bitcoin won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876574&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876569&lt;br&gt;Nope.
