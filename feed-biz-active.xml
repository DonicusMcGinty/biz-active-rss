I’m thinking of a split between SPYI, QQQI, O, and SCHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872716&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;interesting thread, ty anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872526&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;US market has had a good run for about 15 years, but that doesn&amp;#x27;t mean it will continue to. Foreign stocks are beating the everloving fuck out of US stocks this year so for for example.&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s why he said global ETF&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;honestly abusing correlation seems only worth it if the assets have an equal return to stocks, all this junk has such low return even if its negatively correlated you&amp;#x27;re not going to get a free reduction in variance with it without killing your return. That&amp;#x27;s why i heard some paper showed its optimal to just go 100% stocks. Even if your a boomer, bonds aren&amp;#x27;t really worth it, you can just adjust your spending if theres a downturn and still come out ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying to finds stocks/etfs that are weakly correlated seems to be the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872998&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872888&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of assets that meet or beat equity markets with CAGR and are low correlation. Some are right in the data here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872698&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gold for example has a higher average annual return, better risk adjusted return, and a 0.1 correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;All on btc shorts. Outperform those gay indexes for the next three years in one week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;Why do you focus on yield so much instead of total returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a lot of US large cap equity exposure with tax inefficiency if it&amp;#x27;s in a taxable account. You&amp;#x27;ll get big dividend though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like PTY, ASGI, etc for yield personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873145&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872998&lt;br&gt;no it fucking doesn&amp;#x27;t, in the last 110 years it has returned 5% while the stock market returned 10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873145&lt;br&gt;ik this is probably bait but that&amp;#x27;s a very silly time period to look at because before we got off the gold standard it was fixed ounces/USD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaning 0% growth for half that period dragging the CAGR way down lol. Doesn&amp;#x27;t make sense to look at the return pre Nixon shock for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;if you like uncorrelated risk adjusted-returns you should look at alternative investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;Returns are totally dependent on the managers imho, it&amp;#x27;s a cool class. I&amp;#x27;m not a huge fan of the illiquidity personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do like some of them them, especially private farmland/timberland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not a huge fan of venture or growth PE, guess I&amp;#x27;m lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873207&lt;br&gt;have you looked into managed futures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873080&lt;br&gt;I use my brokerage as my main savings account. Instead of getting $500/month in a high yield savings account I rather get $1400, 50-75% I could reinvest. But since you do this for a living I&amp;#x27;m going to listen and allocate more money for growth rather than yield going forward, and you&amp;#x27;re right about the taxes, I didn&amp;#x27;t think too much about that. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873214&lt;br&gt;I cant believe I forgot about those!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use the ETFs for simplicity. ISMF/CTA for crisis alpha. I almost went DBMF too, but I prefer the purer systematic trend heavy ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you have any strong opinions on them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like extreme negative correlation, like -0.4 with 6-8% CAGR which is completely acceptable if you&amp;#x27;re rebalancing with a really aggressive equity portfolio. I considered pairing them with TQQQ or SOXL to be a total jackass at once point and pussed out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873231&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873220&lt;br&gt;You accept more risk (volatility) for those higher returns, that&amp;#x27;s the tradeoff. If you are OK with higher risk then you could always choose one of those balanced allocation funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOR for example just rebalances a 60% stock / 40% bond index portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOA does the same thing but 80% stock (more risk)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These really are the easy button for people that don&amp;#x27;t want to self-manage imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably a good idea to put the portion that&amp;#x27;s your emergency fund into something boring and very lowvol but decent yield. Check out JPST, that might be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873222&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;those are the returns for my managed futures program, im a CTA. its great uncorrelated returns but theres a lot of programs that under perform or blow up (-60%+ years). its definitely more liquid than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873270&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873256&lt;br&gt;Damn dude you&amp;#x27;re crushing it. What&amp;#x27;s the time period on those returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind if I ask what your strategy is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any specific managed futures ETFs you like? Are they even close to replicating the actuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873270&lt;br&gt;thats 20 months of performance trading 8 different futures markets. semi-systematic medium frequency trend following. im not too familiar with the ETFs that track managed futures but they usually focus on the billion dollar CTAs and those programs are lower returns lower risk just trying to be uncorrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873448&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873184&lt;br&gt;ok, its still not beating the stock market unlike your claim, and if you take the last 3 years out and it drops a lot. That is insane volatility that it doesn&amp;#x27;t converge after 50 years. Realistically the actual return is maybe 7% and you get very long periods of dogshit ~3%, and for all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m currently halfway through finishing my CFP course&lt;br&gt;Any advice for someone trying to hit the ground running, beyond spamming LinkedIn? Or should I just accept that this job market is going to rape me until I give up hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Cant ai just do most of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;This. Almost tooka financial advisor job. Then I realized, &amp;quot;why the fuck would anybody talk to a human about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Cause the AI will tell you something plausible that it thinks you want to hear, and it will partially or mostly hallucinate the data it uses to deliver that response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Do you hold any bitcoin? What are your thoughts on it and does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874040&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872561&lt;br&gt;I am a europoor(in a very poor country) so I dont think i have access to most the stuff you are listing. I can only buy ETFs, I have most my portfolio in a Global market cap ETF some in europe ETF and a little in small cap value international and emerging markets. Also bought a sizable stack of silver sub 30 dollars but its going to be a bitch to sell. I dont invest in bonds since I think that every government will just keep on printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874046&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873450&lt;br&gt;Connections are everything, and the exam will be easier than you think. The classes were hugely valuable, were harder and more useful than my master&amp;#x27;s degree courses. Most companies will have you try to peddle shit insurance products to friends/family at the entry level it&amp;#x27;s gross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Maybe someday, not right now. For what &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873827 said and because it just sucks at answering niche or complex questions. When I ask it things it usually feeds me flat out wrong answers that would be passable to someone that didn&amp;#x27;t do any research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example is having it try to pick stocks. Gets obliterated by the index funds every time. It&amp;#x27;s a consistent loser at this because it can&amp;#x27;t make forward projections and the question is too complicated for it. Tax questions are a horror show too, you&amp;#x27;d think it would be good at those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main issue with AI in my eyes is that it just doesn&amp;#x27;t understand humans/human nature. Most of my job is behavioral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;I do, I made a bunch of money in it 2016ish and now build and rebalance a position in my retirement accounts (5-10% allocation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874061&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874040&lt;br&gt;Wish I knew more about EU investing, I&amp;#x27;m completely specialized for US investing so it&amp;#x27;s out of my wheelhouse. I only have a handful of expat/foreign clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EU bonds have been zero or even negative for a long time. I won&amp;#x27;t touch them because they don&amp;#x27;t compensate you for loaning them money, and I can&amp;#x27;t believe people keep buying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently it has something to do with their SIPC insurance equivalent, safer park for cash than a checking account basically because of the federal coverage you get by buying a bond. I haven&amp;#x27;t looked much into it just what I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgot to answer this part. We don&amp;#x27;t buy it in our portfolios, but we do help clients manage the risk associated with it. Some people are believers in crypto so we highlight the risks (volatility, no intrinsic value, etc) and then work with them to figure out how much of their overall investments is a prudent amount to put into that risk asset. I personally cap myself at 10% for both gold and crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto is actually considered speculation instead of investing by most managers. Kind of like commodities/gold/NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874261&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873448&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;its still not beating the stock market &lt;br&gt;It does in the 26-year backward looking period in the data array from the picture by 30bp. Instead of just pulling 7% out of your booty you could spend 10 seconds doing the present value calculation if you really wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s about 9.8% annualized if you go all the way back to &amp;#x27;71 from now ($39-$5,000). That&amp;#x27;s definitely nothing to scoff at when constructing a portfolio and hedging equity markets considering the 0.1 correlation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;That is insane volatility&lt;br&gt;Volatility is good in a portfolio of non-correlated assets that&amp;#x27;s rebalanced outside of tolerance bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market&lt;br&gt;Almost keeps up with it and doesn&amp;#x27;t move in the same direction, which is the idea. Non-correlated assets, rebalancing the volatility, and risk-return tradeoff are portfolio construction 101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874286&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright anon, I&amp;#x27;m out. Have a great day and I hope every one of you gets to retire early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS long nursing homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874295&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Is there a gap in the asset management &amp;amp; financial planning software market? Seems you are just using an excel sheet there. Is there any way your life could be easier or more automated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a developer and I like money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874345&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874295&lt;br&gt;The software is pretty comprehensive and generally way deeper than just an excel sheet, but of course there&amp;#x27;s an industry spectrum of how deep/detailed the analysis goes by firm and by program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some is straight up basically a cash flows projection laid on top of a balance sheet (excel). The people that use this are shitty whole life insurance people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the auxiliary software where the money is at right now it seems. AI that reads trusts using OCR and spits out a summary to help you find issues. Tax software. Stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our software for portfolio management (have used 3) is AWFUL though. That&amp;#x27;s a big gap for asset management imho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>IMF calls on China to cut industrial subsidies in half — 30 replies — 120.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872964</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872964?lm=1771514456</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:20:56 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;IMF calls on China to cut industrial subsidies in half&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872964'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 30 • Updated: 2026-02-19 15:20 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872971&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;This is a strategic move by the Chinese to kill off the competition in other countries so the Chinese companies can dominate the sectors and then raise the prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;i&amp;#x27;m sure china will get right on that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872978&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;jews mad&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872971&lt;br&gt;they can do it forever without raising the prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872979&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872978&lt;br&gt;Nah, they raise the prices once they kill off the competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872985&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;So...just do the opposite of what the IMF says? Got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873110&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872979&lt;br&gt;So I enjoy cheapies and then dumbasses who didnt buy cheapies have to pay more? Sounds like a plus to me&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Then they get expensive and lose to new competition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873120&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872971&lt;br&gt;So they&amp;#x27;re doing exactly what American conglomerates like Amazon did for like 20 years. But now it&amp;#x27;s suddenly a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873123&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873120&lt;br&gt;yes. China bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873185&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;Where is the money for these subsidies coming from even? I bet they are getting into a lot of hidden debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873452&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;If i were china, i would double industrial subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873185&lt;br&gt;China has the largest money supply growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873524&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873452&lt;br&gt;then don&amp;#x27;t complain that the entire western world tariffs your subsidising commie ass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873590&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;capitalists asking communists to be more communist because they&amp;#x27;re making capitalism look bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873615&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873505&lt;br&gt;at least they get something in return from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873690&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873590&lt;br&gt;Subs are communist, not capitalist. So they&amp;#x27;re asking commies to be less commie because they btfo capitalism. Which is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873710&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873690&lt;br&gt;this is true.

THEY CAN ONLY GO TO ISRAEL!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873771&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873712&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873794&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873524&lt;br&gt;American retard&lt;br&gt;The mental gymnastics and maximum levels of hipocracy and dishonesty you&amp;#x27;re willing to to go is really quite sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873798&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873120&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s only ok if ameri fats do it, m&amp;#x27;kay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873813&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873819&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s really fucked up China doesn’t send aid to Israel. It’s like they don’t care about the Jewish People.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873907&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;China subsidizes the entire world&amp;#x27;s solar panels and electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874063&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872971&lt;br&gt;Once they raise prices then other nations will become competitive though? And China will be in huge debt while those other countries can just add debt to add production and still be less leveraged than China? Not sure what the problem is. Upside for China is that they build infrastructure, upside for others is that China is paying for your goods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874092&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872971&lt;br&gt;Damn, that&amp;#x27;s sneaky. I wonder where they learned to do something like that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874096&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;Is the IMF forgetting the Communist party in China owns everything? The CCP will allow someone to run their companies but subsidizing their companies is just robbing Peter to pay Paul. Telling them to stop subsidizing is like telling a CEO to stop paying his own employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874063&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Once they raise prices then other nations will become competitive though&lt;br&gt;Not if you kill off the industry in that country and they have to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872971&lt;br&gt;China already dominates many sectors (e.g. LFP batteries, PVs) and yet prices just keep dropping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874165&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874134&lt;br&gt;The whole point of the finance industry is to enable rapid rotations into money-making fields. Cars for example have been oversaturated for decades, can you rationalize why US automakers should be shitting out millions of taxpayer-subsidized cars? It would be more productive for that effort to be put towards profitable activities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874338&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;the hell...? that isnt fair, only america is allowed doing that like they did with their dairy cartel (but failed as no one wants your estrogen &amp;quot;milk&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>why would anyone live here — 42 replies — 97.2/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797?lm=1771513418</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:03:38 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;why would anyone live here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 42 • Updated: 2026-02-19 15:03 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;i recently moved to NYC to work for a &amp;quot;lucrative salary&amp;quot; (not really, because this place drains you of all your income) and after working here for 4 months i dont know why anyone would willingly live here&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the entire city smells like rotting shit, cigarette buds and dead animals, not a faint smell, an extremely strong odor that you&amp;#x27;ll eventually just become nose blind to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;homeless people, fucking everywhere, when i left my apartment there were homeless people sleeping in the hallways of my complex, when you go on walk there are homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk with a PILLOW and BLANKET while regular people walk over them like this is just some normal fucking occurrence (and in this shithole it is) never ever have i seen some shit like this even in the worst of cities ive lived in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;heroin needles, weed bags, cigarette buds &amp;amp; the occasional dildo just scattered across the city sidewalks, your constantly walking over human shit, broken bottles or dime bags&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rats and rodents EVERYWHERE. il never forget the time i bought a pizza from one of the disgusting street vendors and when i sat down at a table one of the rats were circling my feet trying to climb my leg for a bite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the &amp;quot;public transport&amp;quot; system is a just permanent housing for the mentally ill, every time i had to ride the subway i was scared for my life because of all the fucking looneys that inhabit the train systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is just off the top of my head, but i think the biggest mindfuck of it all is that its EXPENSIVE to live here its gonna cost you not 50k, not 100k, not 200k, to live comfortably by yourself you need 250K yearly in manhattan. 250k, to live among violent homeless people, 250k to constantly have to walk in rotting shit and roadkill. 250k to have your ears blown out by car horns &amp;amp; niggerbabble, 250k to be forced to smell the most putried scents imaginable i dont know why anyone sane would live here, this place is some sort of social experiment, some sort of anonmoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Go back to your trailer park, pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872853&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;You know the phrase &amp;quot;If you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re not making it.

NYC is an absolute shithole. I&amp;#x27;m sure there are some nice neighborhoods, but you are deeply brainwashed if you think NYC is a nice city. Literally every major city in Japan is nicer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872933&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872923&lt;br&gt;No you used strawman arguments.

You should have seen it when it was actually bad, back in the 1970s!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The movie &amp;quot;Death Wish&amp;quot; had to sanitize it a lot to be presentable on a movie screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872950&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872859&lt;br&gt;Actually, AIDS dies on contact with oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872952&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872950&lt;br&gt;I see millions of leftists and niggers running around breathing so that&amp;#x27;s a flat out lie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872963&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872933&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872933&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nobody is afraid of walking there&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;every time i had to ride the subway i was scared for my life&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re going to lie don&amp;#x27;t reply to my posts pussy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872967&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872934&lt;br&gt;None of those women are interested in settling down. They’re chasing the sex and the city meme. NYC is famous for its shit dating scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872990&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Which neighborhood do you live in? I&amp;#x27;m in Williamsburg. That said, yeah, NYC is a shithole. I&amp;#x27;ve lived in DC and Miami, and both those cities are much cleaner and aesthetic than here. I could put up with the dirtiness and homelessness if it weren&amp;#x27;t fucking cold and dark here for 5 months out of the year. It&amp;#x27;s depressing. I moved to NYC for a work opportunity and career advancement. But now I&amp;#x27;m trying to pivot industries and get into banking, but no luck so far. I&amp;#x27;ll probably stay here 4-5 years total tops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;You don’t love the hustle and bustle of the big city enough clearly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;wagie realizes NYC is for rich people&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A tale old as time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873022&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One time i was in NYC and I saw an indian cab driver empty his piss bottle out in the street from his cab. Can confirm there&amp;#x27;s lots of trash and there&amp;#x27;s a piss smell. Have you considered Boston OP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in NYC for like two hours and will never return &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Homeless people literally fucking everywhere &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Niggers drinking and smoking crack on the street &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Needles everywhere &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Had to step off the sidewalk because some spic auto shop had cars parked all over the sidewalk &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Almost got crashed into three times &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Had to pay $30 in tolls or some other ridiculous number just to drive in and out &lt;br&gt;If you can work remotely but need NY tax residency just move somewhere else in the state. Not Rochester though, it&amp;#x27;s just as much of a hellhole, just smaller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872863&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;i was paying over 150k &lt;br&gt;You mean making? &lt;br&gt;Or did you mean you were paying $12,500 per month? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you were only making 150k then I&amp;#x27;m completely unsurprised you felt like a bitter poorfag in NYC. I make that much in a medium/low cost city in the Midwest and feel like I could use a lot more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you moved there for a career and only made that much then yeah I think you weren&amp;#x27;t anywhere close to making an optimal move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I&amp;#x27;m saying is you&amp;#x27;re a.) soft as fuck and b.) not nearly as intelligent or valuable as you think you are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;so? its jew york, its there to someone to nuke it.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873706&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;OP can&amp;#x27;t handle the hustle and bustle of NYC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873716&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;i heard there are more dating age women than men in nyc. so might be good if you&amp;#x27;re looking to SUCKNFUCK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873754&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873067&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;All I&amp;#x27;m saying is you&amp;#x27;re a.) soft as fuck and b.) not nearly as intelligent or valuable as you think you are&lt;br&gt;Go live there pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873892&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873754&lt;br&gt;fun fact &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873067 doesnt realize the inverse of &amp;quot;if you can make it in nyc you can make it anywhere&amp;quot; is the actual truth. there are people that cannot make it out of nyc. there is a huge swaths of the country where the only employer is dollar general paying $1-2/hr above minimum wage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;any retard can come to nyc and get a six figure job, and if they dont aspire to ever own property or live in a super trendy/high end part of the city they&amp;#x27;ll be fine. meanwhile if they stayed in florida or ohio or even suburban connecticut they probably would&amp;#x27;ve been stuck working retail or at best making $60,000 a year in a place where meals still cost $14-20 and gas is still $3 a gallon and his rent is still retarded high like $1800-2400/mo because nyc/la/boston set rental pricing for the rest of the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873895&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been to NYC and none of that happened to me howeverbeit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873906&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Heh sounds exactly like my experience as an euro whi visited the city two years ago. I got assaulted by some young negress 15 minutes after i had arrived in the city, two blocks from the times square. The whole place was worse than Brasil and indeed full of homeless and untreated schizophrenics. Felt like third world to an european like me. Really showed how much USA has decayed when it’s normal for them to live in dangerous third world cities like this. Paris was literal heaven compared to it. Everything was clean, almost zero homeless, immigrants were working the shit jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873913&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873895&lt;br&gt;the streets are pretty disgusting after a month of frozen snow finally melting im excited for the rain tomorrow &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873906&lt;br&gt;times square is a shithole thoughever&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;its like me saying all of france is marseilles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873926&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873892&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;or at best making $60,000 a year in a place where meals still cost $14-20 and gas is still $3 a gallon and his rent is still retarded high like $1800-2400/mo because nyc/la/boston set rental pricing for the rest of the country&lt;br&gt;Fucking trvke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I live in Ohio making ~62k a year gross and gas prices are $2.90-$4.00 depending on the octane level you need, a meal is $25, a drink at a bar is $15, and rent in the ghetto is $1000-1200 for a studio, or $1500+ if you don&amp;#x27;t want to get shot. On top of that my health insurance is $200 a month, my car insurance is $100 a month, and there are a million other expenses that don&amp;#x27;t get cheaper because I live here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving to a major west or east coast city would cost me MAYBE $1500 a month in additional expenses, but I would make that all back in increased salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873906&lt;br&gt;Oh and people we’re unironically like 75% brown. Any european big city will have by default by population alone more attractive white women. USA has truly fallen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873913&lt;br&gt;I thought my hotel was in some shithole area until i found it was literally at the ”good part of the city” at upper west side. Didn’t matter, the whole place is full of homeless with decayed infrastructure if we don’t count the skyscrapers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874025&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873983&lt;br&gt;anywhere near nycha public housing (x houses like fredrick douglass houses which you were probably close to) or methadone clinics (8th ave between 32nd to 44th street) will be shitty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;every euro visits midtown when really you should be visiting the lower east side and upper brooklyn, midtown manhattan is all commercial office buildings. upper manhattan is rich jews in million dollar penthouses and museums/central park getting shittier the further you go up (the old joke was white people would all get off at 96th st)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i will give you nyc women are fucking ugly, its something in the water. i think florida unironically has better looking women by a few points. montreal has the best looking women in north america. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;marseilles was bad enough that i cannot take euros seriously when they complain about america&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874253&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;The trick is to cost of life max&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want to best ratio income:cost of life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking into account other variables such as opportunities (i guess NY have plenty), quality of life (kek), social life, proximity to family etc&lt;br&gt;And of course taxes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real cheat code being to remote from a shithole with a fat 6 fig, but I personally don&amp;#x27;t feel like fucking whores in Pattaya and have my passport in a safe. But there&amp;#x27;s layers to it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway please stay in NY don&amp;#x27;t come to my cuntry making real estate too expensive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874263&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Never been but I’ve been to Shitcago many times and it always smells like raw sewage it makes me sick.

Have you ever met an Asian with empathy or altruism? I just don’t think their brains are capable of much so we see them as something less.

How do the most expensive vehicles have the worst drivers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871805&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is it about motorcycles that inspire so much seethe? Is it because 4chuds are high inhib pussy incels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871884&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is in 2014, 2017, 2021 you could take 10,000 bucks and buy basically anything and a 10x was guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember taking 2021 for granted lol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2024 bull run saw an initial pump from alts from january to april and then htey just bled from april to september, then bled again from december to may, and from may 2025 to present the bulk of alts bled out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember seeing microstrategy and I was like &amp;quot;gonna buy that when bitcoin goes back to 50k&amp;quot;. Then I saw MSTX. Hell yeah, double your money for each MSTR move, and MSTR was double bitcoin. A run to 100k from 50k would be an easy 8x. And it was. But I sold before the election and fumbled it. The fumbler. It&amp;#x27;s easy to create a perfect plan in your mind, and watch it play out exactly as you said it would, but it takes a lot of conviction to not fuck it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now most markets are way up. 2026, 2022, 2018, midterm years have slow market growth. The time to buy it was 2023, the time to make it was 2024, the time to swap into alts like KTA and HYPE and AVANTIS was 2025. I called everything correctly but fucked up the one thing that mattered- buying, and holding to a 10x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871780&lt;br&gt;Boomers love driving big SUVs for some reason. Makes them &amp;quot;feel safe&amp;quot; or some shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872189&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Bug people, soulless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;Because they are literally lower quality organisms.

Very powerful people ironically fear death a lot so they somehow believe this can save them from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873616&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864738&lt;br&gt;They fear China the most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873938&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863529&lt;br&gt;What a dumb retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873940&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868075&lt;br&gt;This was denied by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873942&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862922&lt;br&gt;He could have make it if he had better control of his brakes, I think he&amp;#x27;s one of these riders who only use the front brake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I've come to the conclusion that... — 13 replies — 52.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873925</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873925?lm=1771514194</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:16:34 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve come to the conclusion that...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61873925'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 13 • Updated: 2026-02-19 15:16 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI has completely mogged Crypto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto use to be the thing people went full retarded and YOLO&amp;#x27;d their life savings into, now nobody does that anymore, but they&amp;#x27;re doing it with AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the Venture Capital funding is going into AI, there&amp;#x27;s very little VC left going into Crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not saying it&amp;#x27;s 100% over forever for us Cryptocels, but with the way things look, I wont be surprised if we have a 10+ year long crypto winter where nobody gives a single fuck about it, and Bitcoin could fall way lower than anyone within the space expects it to fall &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, in the long-term you&amp;#x27;ll see a return to Bitcoin/Crypto overall as people who made it big with AI look for a way to secure their gains in limited supply assets like Bitcoin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its just overall cooked right now and our real lives aren&amp;#x27;t gona start again for another 10 years at least&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873929&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep. &lt;br&gt;AI is a much better scam than crypto.

They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870164&lt;br&gt;did you read anything of what i said there and ignored it or are you just retarded?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Just don&amp;#x27;t collect data for commercial purposes&lt;br&gt;as a user, having to click on shit on every website for gdpr is annoying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It does but not allowing certain monetization strategies of the data, informing you about how, which and why what points of data are used and giving the EU a mechanism to fight against, mostly foreign, companies violating your privacy.&lt;br&gt;yeah you definitely are retarded. which part of &amp;quot;it does not protect my data&amp;quot; did you not understand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870199&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;starting a business is very easy on both sides of the atlantic. scaling is harder in the EU because it&amp;#x27;s a fragmented market with wildly different rulesets between member states and capital markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870203&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870191&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;as a user, having to click on shit on every website for gdpr is annoying&lt;br&gt;Oh the horror! Let me guess, in most cases you just have to click &amp;#x27;disable all&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;save&amp;#x27; right? Here&amp;#x27;s a pro-tip to save you the time: Block the domain or script they use for their cookie banners&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;which part of &amp;quot;it does not protect my data&amp;quot; did you not understand?&lt;br&gt;The part where you lied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870682&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870203&lt;br&gt;ah, i see, you are retarded. just because some laws that are lax exist doesn&amp;#x27;t mean data is protected, you fucking retarded faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870744&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870065&lt;br&gt;it started long before post-WW2 tho, germs bureaucracymaxxed post-reunification during the 2nd Reich, from 1871 onward.&lt;br&gt;At first it was to keep in check all the landers trying to take the lion&amp;#x27;s share of federal credits and centralize power. And it worked gud, but then it progressively became the hellscape kafkaian machine we all know.&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s how you know the hallofcost never happened, becuz you can be sure nazis would have made endless paperworks addressing the situation, down to the very last jewish pubic hair, but we didn&amp;#x27;t find any document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop eating the commie propaganda. Europeans don&amp;#x27;t have savings for shit, they just have stable expenses but all their wealth is tied to inheriting homes. That&amp;#x27;s why homes are basically untaxed while stocks are treated like financial Nazism. You aren&amp;#x27;t going to spend more a healthy young person in the US, the real benefit of Europe is the private healthcare is very cheap and good &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting businesses in Europe sucks because of two factors. The first is low liquidity and consumer spending: unlike the US, people don&amp;#x27;t spend nearly as much, have as much to spend, or make debt. So there isn&amp;#x27;t much room for anyone to buy something new - successful businesses target liquid tourists or B2B, where they write off the huge taxes as expenses. Over regulated financial market also leads to lower liquidity and more difficulty getting loans and investors, you rely on government programs run by middle aged menopausal cunts that have never worked more than 28 hours a week &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other issue is labor laws and public perception. It&amp;#x27;s morally bankrupt to try and get more money, why aren&amp;#x27;t you happy being average, why are you trying to pull ahead. Anyone you hire can&amp;#x27;t be fired, you can&amp;#x27;t have low compensation with offset packages to get high skill labor, you need to suck some blue blooded cock to get money and not wait years for whatever permits you&amp;#x27;ll need, because they were born out of nobility and still have half the money and connections &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eurotards freak out about Epstein but every European politician and rich person rapes babies for breakfast. It&amp;#x27;s just 1) not pedo to them if they&amp;#x27;re over 14 bc muh age of consent and 2) they hide in the shadows unlike Americans, they try to be as unnoticed as possible, give a few concessions to the poor and continue ruling sucking and fucking like they&amp;#x27;ve been doing the past thousand years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870889&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870103&lt;br&gt;What are the reforms that boomers are blocking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870915&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869942&lt;br&gt;Yeah i feel the same. Sex, drugs and love are already the ultimate sensations and none of them are expensive. All luxuries are pretty worthless add-ons and don’t feel special. You just have a bigger bed, or a bigger car, not anything you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870937&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s complete bullshit, stop making up fantasies in your mind. If there is ONE thing still somewhat running smoothly in western Europe, it&amp;#x27;s free healthcare.&lt;br&gt;Contrary to you i know what i&amp;#x27;m talking about since i was on the operation table just a month ago to fix few lower vertebrae after a bike accident. I never had to wait for anything more than few days, nor did i have to spend a single penny on pre-procedures, examinations or for the hospital stay/operation/anesthesia/post-op medication. And i don&amp;#x27;t have any health mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It probably would have costed me a bazillion goybux in the jewSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870937&lt;br&gt;Why the fuck would it cost bajillions, even shit insurance has a max out of pocket of like 10k. If you don&amp;#x27;t have a job medicaid literally covers everything for free, the real problem is half the people that qualify are too fucking stupid to sign up for it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also if the accident wasn&amp;#x27;t your fault you could sue for big money, in Europe they&amp;#x27;re just like meh accidents happen enjoy the lifelong complications faggot. I will agree southern European health systems are pretty decent and their private healthcare is fantastic and cheap, but if you&amp;#x27;re German or some shit I&amp;#x27;d rather have the US system, you guys pay more in healthcare tax than any American if you have a half decent job and if you get anything where you may actually die they just say, yeah you&amp;#x27;re fucked settle your affairs or the bureaucracy will give the rest of your family a stroke, no point trying any more it&amp;#x27;s an inefficient allocation of resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;This is extremely short-sighted of them, they will end up losing the capacity to compete and fall behind slowly, they actually already are, then when they slowly go on closing business left and right from ever increasing ineficiency. What else can they even do but borrow more and more for the worst possible spending a state can do, paying bills, a budget blackhole, increasing inflation and making money useless and as those countries get poorer the services will also get far far far worse and extremely corrupt, not even talking about how such aging will make it even worse. Honestly this is reading like what happened to argentina, greece and other latam and thirdies socialist govts did, it will work fine as long as the economy can keep it, when it starts to shrink it will be poverty hell. I will agree that america treats us workers pretty bad, but this welfare paradise of the EU won&amp;#x27;t work for long either, they will end up forced to cut things and get closer to us if they want to survive a world with China, India, US and former colonies being no longer mudhutts but mildly developed enough to make raw resources more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Lots of retards ITT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Setting up a business is child&amp;#x27;s play in places like Denmark, Sweden, Estonia. Setting up, doing tax returns and all interactions with gov is handled through online ID and takes seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Places like Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia are selling themselves as business friendly. Very low taxes. Some places like Bulgaria have extremely low dividend taxes so you pay yourself with dividends. Romania has a corporate setup where you pay a tiny percentage on the turnover. Ideal for freelancers or small business with high margins or just extreme low expense. In all of these places, corporate setups and accountants cost next to nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you have some almost offshore jurisdictions still in the EU with insanely beneficial rules for some niches and very low taxes. Like Cyprus and Malta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now regulations, what regulations? Anything (except guns, booze, some gambling, cigarettes I guess) is traded freely between the states under the same legislation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also: we get sued way less over here. Do the math on that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871050&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; wife started selling her paintings&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; she declared herself first, this was needed to attend some events&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; French government instantly asks her for €800, before she has made her first sale&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; this is what they estimate she&amp;#x27;d owe them at the end of the year based on their estimates of how much she will earn, so they ask for it upfront&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you can contest it but it&amp;#x27;s actually faster to wait for the year to end so they are proven wrong&lt;br&gt;I hate them so much...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871051&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;taxes&lt;br&gt;depends where, some places will legit rape your revenue&lt;br&gt;Combined with some insane regulations and you legit can&amp;#x27;t start a company&lt;br&gt;Best example is France, fucked up taxes, and if you want to get into tech, or anything that involves personal data, you need cough up 6 to 7 figures so that your cyber security is in the norm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;I will die long before I see some high tech company or even mid tier industry appear in latam, africa or even india, they will always be turning up cheap raw resources because they are simply brown subhumans with low iq, not even talking about russia post-war. Its an unfounded fearmongering that we will ever have to compete with them lol, you forget europe will never fall to thirdie level of mismanagement simple because we are better educated and white. At the very worst unlikely scenario we will always make money from tourism anyway, but honestly this is all american envy for no reason, we are not stopping you from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871116&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871023&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re admitting you can only live off arbitrage? Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria, Romania is actually marginally based because it&amp;#x27;s spread its asshole to US companies for cheap EU labor, those Nordic countries you listed have a smaller economy than Pennsylvania so yeah if you want to sell troon support stickers you&amp;#x27;re good but you&amp;#x27;re not going to make shit otherwise &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portugal is also kind of based but it fully relies on US and other European investments, as well as inexistent enforcement of labor laws and pathetic salaries. I don&amp;#x27;t get how you&amp;#x27;d start up there without the first 100k being gifted though, or the family having land, or working abroad first &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire opening a bakery or car wash or hamster fentanyl university of arts like the US, there&amp;#x27;s no consumer spending to eat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871180&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire&lt;br&gt;Lmao, just look at economic charts, most european economies have high tech industry as the main economic activity, american bullshit as usual, nobody needs to be a millionaire in europe, we already live better than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria,&lt;br&gt;As I said, you are a fucking retard. Your company is in Bulgaria, but you sell to fucking anyone in EU the same way while paying insanely low corporate tax and next to no admin fees. You ship from anywhere you want in the EU, or have staff in bloody Manila if you wish. What the fuck does that have to do with arbitrage? You incorporate wherever you want since it is your legal right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doubt you are entrepreneurial material though, so do not bother grokking the potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871000&lt;br&gt;The suing thing is the biggest AIDS of USA. People are already well compensated enough in europe for their troubles. The ”if you make a honest mistake, someone will see their opportinity and sue you and financially destroy your life” mentality just creates even more stress to an already high stress environment of USA. It just makes people act even more legally defensive at every turn and creates useless bureucracy and slows things down. Getting raped when everything didn’t go 100% nicely is not something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;This is the most midwit take and the reason why USA is failing now (it has become a nation of midwits due to poor public education). People have been saying this for decades but right now europe is in a bullrun while USA has been becoming an oligarchic brasil since the 80s. Clearly socialism doesn&amp;#x27;t just lead to inefficiency but instead to more efficiency for all instead of just few hoarding the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871353&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871183&lt;br&gt;Learn to read Fritz, you are saying what I&amp;#x27;m saying while sounding like a mong. You&amp;#x27;re setting up in poor countries to sell to richer countries&amp;#x27; businesses while using the common market, it&amp;#x27;s geographic arbitrage you sausage guzzling troon, and you&amp;#x27;re selling to businesses. All that free education and you&amp;#x27;re still poorer than a fucking car salesman in Pensacola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871500&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871214&lt;br&gt;What? Excluding Pooland all major eu economies have stopped growing or deacelerated fast, people were saying it for decades with reason, if it wasnt for a miraculous fall of the ussr and a flood of cheap raw resources and energy with negligible transport costs from russia it would&amp;#x27;ve happened earlier as it did post-2008 when europe started to lag more and more behind the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867554&lt;br&gt;Nigger&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;give us taxes goy&lt;br&gt;ok, well, how much&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;We don&amp;#x27;t know uwu&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you tell us&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but if you&amp;#x27;re wrong we get to take even more of your money lol&lt;br&gt;you just said you don&amp;#x27;t know what I owe&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thats right &lt;br&gt;so how do you know if I pay wrong?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Don&amp;#x27;t get cheeky with us you little shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871570&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871500&lt;br&gt;That guy is fucking retarded why even argue. The average European is still a moron, printing useless degrees doesn&amp;#x27;t make people smarter. They still cuck themselves daily. He&amp;#x27;s happy to never own anything so his blue blooded friends can hoard the land and wealth like they&amp;#x27;ve always done &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Muh healthcare muh taxes &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half of every country is too fucking poor to pay tax, and the top 10% isn&amp;#x27;t stupid enough to pay tax, so the middle class just pays 50% of their income while being happy they can rent a shit hole for life and that they&amp;#x27;re better off unemployed than working in terms of life quality &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will definitely return to Europe once my nest egg is built, I&amp;#x27;ll just live in 2 different countries 179 days a year and live off US divvies therefore paying no retard tax and just paying private healthcare out of pocket, or if I really make it just pay the flat 100k Italian tax and get private insurance for 300 a month that will pay for top quality coverage while I sip Italian wines and hire high end eastern european hookers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871624&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871570&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can’t get women otherwise so has to pay for hookers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for revealing that you’re some dysfunctional weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871681&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871624&lt;br&gt;Thanks for showing why you&amp;#x27;re weak, religious morals won&amp;#x27;t get you anywhere. Also very europilled, way more Europeans use hookers than Americans outside the lower class - but you pretend like it&amp;#x27;s somehow weird while you haven&amp;#x27;t even been to church since your communion &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now I bang for free, outside working and life only about one chick a week, but you bet your ass I&amp;#x27;ll buy some dimes when I can live off passive income, at least they&amp;#x27;re safe and making good money unlike the daughters you gave away to arabs to be beaten and bred to show how woke you are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871776&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many countries are gatekept by language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;People are doing a lot of grifting and lobby work for deregulation. Starting a business isn&amp;#x27;t really difficult.&lt;br&gt;There are some bad things, in Germany for example financing rounds require a notary to read out the whole contract in person to you. But a lot of these things you and 90% of small business owners won&amp;#x27;t encounter in practice&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;You legitimately think accountants only exist in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868110&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not bullshit. Europeans are smart. The European rich just refused to pay programmers so any good programmer went to America over the past 35 fucking years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake and Gay Economy — 43 replies — 27.5/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520?lm=1771509338</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 13:55:38 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Fake and Gay Economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 43 • Updated: 2026-02-19 13:55 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will this gay as economy finally collapse and how can i profit from it?&lt;br&gt;Its ridiculous the woman at our workplace contribute nothing to the company and make more money than i do&lt;br&gt;Its infuriating we just had a bunch of lay offs and we lost some of oir best workers but somehow a bunch of HR shits who do nothing all day still work here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HR is a necessary function, chud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871530&lt;br&gt;For what?&lt;br&gt;Genuinely why do we need it to this extent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Protect the corp from lawsuits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872085&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;We dont live in capitalist system&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its been state capitalism for long time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;This is a fiat problem, not a capitalism problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872170&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;The purpose of HR is to protect the company.

I instantly know there is a schizo take coming when i read this. Some schizo takes are interesting, some are even good, some are good to think through and some are just funny to read. But they stzill are schizo takes and mostly bullshit influeces too much by wish bias. So how and where did this phrase pick up with schizos. When i know, its around 2021/2022 when the schizo&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;economy will collapse and people will starve due to lockdowns&lt;br&gt;did not materialize. Then they started with this phrase to somehow save their prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873806&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no less than three seething replies about muh real capitalism&lt;br&gt;If you abolished the state it would be reinvented by the wealthy overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;Fake and gay was in use when I 1st started using this site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873988&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Hopefully never because I have a fake overpaid job, just not in HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>&gt;you idiots are holding 1s and 0s on a computer, while my wealth is secure in physical precious meta-ACK — 74 replies — 7.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863917</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863917?lm=1771477558</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:05:58 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&amp;gt;you idiots are holding 1s and 0s on a computer, while my wealth is secure in physical precious meta-ACK&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61863917'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 74 • Updated: 2026-02-19 05:05 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;you idiots are holding 1s and 0s on a computer, while my wealth is secure in physical precious meta-ACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61863927&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;you dumb asses really just keep metals sitting around your zero security home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864275&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to be extremely stupid to hoard precious metals, as a private citizen.

Be careful if you copy/paste addresses anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61867928&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864463&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;gf/wife&lt;br&gt;I have neither, so I am safe there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867922&lt;br&gt;yeah which is why you do your business on a computer that is only used for BTC and exchanges, and on Linux&lt;br&gt;if you can&amp;#x27;t do this you&amp;#x27;re brown, its effortless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868014&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;only used for btc and exchanges&lt;br&gt;reasonable&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and on linux&lt;br&gt;javascript can manipulate what goes into your clipboard when you copy or cut, being on linux wont change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868340&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864496&lt;br&gt;Bank vault. That is where you hide it. It could easily take 20 years for her to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864275&lt;br&gt;How they would go in my house? I don&amp;#x27;t leave the door open, I&amp;#x27;m here most of the time and I live in a gated community with no crime whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868490&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868340&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be immediately confiscated by the government and defeat the purpose of holding physical metal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868350&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re aware the banks have door locks, employees, armed guards, and security systems, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868527&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t understand. Silver is not some rug shitcoin that will drop 30% tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868584&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bet he was like &amp;quot;You guys should buy SILVER, you should have bought SILVER like me :) I bought so much SILVER, you want to know how much SILVER I bought? Let me tell you how much my SILVER is worth today :)&amp;quot; like every other silverfag so that everyone everywhere knew he had a bunch of silver bars at his house waiting to be stolen&lt;br&gt;NOBODY knows about my gold. It lives in a tin under a floorboard. If people ask me about investments I just say it&amp;#x27;s too complicated for me and I don&amp;#x27;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868620&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864318&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Trump writes another gold executive order like FDR&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cops at your door, &amp;quot;surrender your precious metals or you will be charged&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;what gold dunno what you&amp;#x27;re talking about&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;they arrest you&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;later they show your purchase history and post history to the court&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What now? Lawyer up against the feds? But all your wealth is buried in your backyard and all your cash is worthless from inflation (or they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be stealing your gold). You&amp;#x27;d be better off investing in bullets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868888&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868620&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; property gets auctioned off, because no one is paying the taxes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869243&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868620&lt;br&gt;By your logic 100% of people get arrested because literally all of them will say they don&amp;#x27;t have gold or silver and 95% of the ones saying that are telling the truth, but you think they&amp;#x27;ll be arrested anyway.&lt;br&gt;This is the level of cope and mental gymnastics cryptards have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869253&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oops that clipboard malware destroyed my lifesaving...

Not just gold and silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871637&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;Admitted semi-retard here&lt;br&gt;I was considering putting some of my crypto gains into gold stored in a Swiss vault overseas - not as an investment with expected profit, but just to hold as a hedge against possible doomsday scenarios where any fiat/crypto that I would have chosen to hold instead, suddenly loses all value&lt;br&gt;Obviously the Swiss vault should have better security measures than most home security systems. But are there any reasons I&amp;#x27;m not seeing why I shouldn&amp;#x27;t do this (besides paying a storage fee)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871660&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871637&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;taking your effortlessly stored asset and converting it into an IOU for a piece of metal in a vault on the other side of the planet&lt;br&gt;I swear if BTC doesn&amp;#x27;t catch on and we go back to a metal standard I am torturing you niggers to death in WW3, you are all so retarded.&lt;br&gt;But let me make this really simple for you, in case you are somehow willing to listen:&lt;br&gt;If you want to hedge for a doomsday scenario, your only bet is to have a productive farm, a community that respects you and depends on you, lots of guns and ammunition, and maybe a cellar full of preserved goods especially coffee and cigarettes. If you&amp;#x27;ve read about any fucking situation where shit hits the fan, that&amp;#x27;s pretty much the only thing you can do. Your metal IOU is worthless, your vault of metal is worthless, your Bitcoin is worthless, your property rights are worthless without guns, and your guns are worthless without a community that actually wants you alive and is willing to fight for and or with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61863917&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;one-ounce (28.3g)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871721&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864804&lt;br&gt;Literally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871761&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871660&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Post 9999999 of someone pretending that the fiat collapsing means the end of civilized, organized society and not just a simple redistribution of wealth to those who were smart enough to buy physical silver and gold.&lt;br&gt;*yawn*&lt;br&gt;Got anything new?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872687&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something I never knew about the infamous gold standard exit, is that they did they while the private gold ban was still active. &lt;br&gt;Only being unbanned AFTER decloupling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873076&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871761&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the 5th anniversary of today, someone else is going to have custody of your gold and silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873096&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871572&lt;br&gt;Internet hard line gets nuked in ww3 Oh no muh block chain is down...

Almost anywhere else is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860802&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859145&lt;br&gt;Holy shit imagine thinking thats a good place to live in. The nederlands are already way overpopulated. Our natural habitat which means the place we are most happy at is the forest with a small group of tribespeople.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860804&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860793&lt;br&gt;*in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is living anywhere except Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen the same as admitting that your life is meaningless and that you are NOT the main character and will never make it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861578&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859032&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thirdie hivan complains but won&amp;#x27;t move back(will move to oc instead)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861585&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I live in Chinook montana. I would ask for nothing else&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861591&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I am from D.C.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s full of drones. Some are deluded enough to think being the GS-15 in charge of whatever the fuck department for whatever government agency actually makes them important.&lt;br&gt;It doesn&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61861595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858990&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;IMAGINE LIVING IN A BROWN SHITHOLE&lt;br&gt;D.C. suburbs in 2012 be like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862146&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;Los Angeles is a shithole. San Francisco lost all sovl because no one who lives there is actually from San Francisco anymore. D.C. is literally a dilapidated nigger den. New York is cool and iconic but is also a lonely hive where everyone is disconnected despite living 10,000 to a city block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think you&amp;#x27;ve been to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859319&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;worst street&lt;br&gt;So you admit that the left-wing billionaires delegate certain streets for the homeless while they live on the nice streets in their high rises, with private security?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862164&lt;br&gt;They delegate entire states for the washed out retards to live in, while even the homeless here in LA have more upward mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862210&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Non-Americans&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Main Character&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Even Once&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861591&lt;br&gt;This. I&amp;#x27;m from DC too, but I left that shithole years ago. Everyone is a bureaucratic suit who aspires to work for the government or some adjacent entity. Sure there might be ethnic diversity, but there is no cultural diversity at all. Quite literally everyone is a libtard. Not to mention the women there are not only busted but also extremely deluded in thinking that they deserve Chads. A DC 10 is a Miami or NYC 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862537&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859324&lt;br&gt;Can confirm, LA is great. Every month I have to remember to not self-dox because retards are talking about what a shithole it is here, and I want to take a photo of my window view showing that it looks exactly the same as the white southern suburb they all fantasize about. Just don&amp;#x27;t live in the poor part of town. That rule applies to every city on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61862543&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have *real* mexican food for cheap, no bad weather, and as many asian women and big booty latinas as you could ever want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862380&lt;br&gt;D.C. has long been &amp;quot;Hollywood for ugly people.&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s where ugly people go to make it - with their 6 figure bullshit government job.&lt;br&gt;I lived in Fairfax and worked in Arlington - at least I wasn&amp;#x27;t on the nigger side of the Potomac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864233&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858982&lt;br&gt;These places are all horrible unless you’re rich or are on a clear path to wealth. I’m convinced the only places left on earth where it’s still possible to safely and comfortably raise a family on a middling firstie income are Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe (the Catholic ones in the EU not the orthodox shitholes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864442&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61864233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Eastern Europe&lt;br&gt;Can confirm it&amp;#x27;s comfy as fuck here with just a few hundred grand of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864757&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862146&lt;br&gt;Erm but all my favorite movies take place in those cities so they must be the best and most important in America!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864780&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;most of those cities suck ass and are basically open air prisons for white collar wageslaves. people with money &amp;quot;in LA&amp;quot; live on or near the beach. people with money &amp;quot;in DC&amp;quot; live in surrounding areas like bethesda or chevy chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61864816&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;I enjoy Manhattan and visiting SOCAL but living there would be too much. I lived on in Santa Monica for a year and anytime you&amp;#x27;d want to do something you had to plan around traffic. Not a way to live you entire life. There&amp;#x27;s a ton of great nature in southern California so even if you&amp;#x27;re not into le hustle and bustle you&amp;#x27;re still able to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61868506&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;wow gringos are really fucking retarded, who gives a fuck about your shitty cities??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869839&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61858975&lt;br&gt;Swap Los Angeles for Denver and that list is accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s no surplus of 20-29 year old white women in LA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869848&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61861595&lt;br&gt;NIGGER THIS IS THE COSTCO IN MONTGOMERY VILLAGE MD, GTFO MY VILLAGE NIGGA LONG LIVE 9 RUGA GANG FOR LIFE. LOVE LIVE TAY, FREE BIG AHK. FUCK GTOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869882&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are places for people who already got rich to move to. Who became the main character in the vast opportunities available elsewhere starting from little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poor people and wagies who immediately move there are actually doomed to a lifetime of NPC servitude. You are the background noise and lifeless bodies that the actual rich main characters have to step around in their new map. You just think you&amp;#x27;re a main character because you&amp;#x27;re proximal to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870054&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859145&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;BIG PLACE GOOD&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s it? That&amp;#x27;s your argument?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859324&lt;br&gt;The chud memes are exaggerated, but the economic reality for the vast majority of people is that living in a major metro is basically impossible unless you live like a fucking rat with a hald dozen roommates. Big cities are full of rich people not because that&amp;#x27;s how you get rich and make connections, but because they&amp;#x27;re the only ones that can afford to live there. And the wealth and connections come naturally, when you have lots of rich people together. Big cities are effectively playgrounds for the top 20%, and open air prisons for the rest who work 3 wagie jobs and still can&amp;#x27;t afford rent or utilities and live to serve their rich masters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re already rich then you&amp;#x27;re right: nothing beats a major primary city. More contacts and networking, more opportunities, more fun, more wage slaves to pleasure you. Secondary and tertiary, smaller cities are potentially good for middle income people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872550&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61859001&lt;br&gt;too bad you guys fucked it all up. California used to be great...now you&amp;#x27;re 10 years away from being 1980s South Africa with a few rich people surrounded by hordes of poor colored people. California dudes are still coasting on ego based off the old days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, I still can&amp;#x27;t believe how San Francisco, one of the wealthiest and most beautiful cities on Earth has emptied out. Have you been downtown lately? Its a disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872562&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61862537&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Just don&amp;#x27;t live in the poor part of town.&lt;br&gt;Its not just the rampant homelessness and poverty. No matter where you live the Cali Nanny state will ensure you have no fucking fun. Places like Chicago, NY, Florida, and Austin are waaaaaaay more fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, SoCal latinas are the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872594&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860802&lt;br&gt;trvthnvke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872550&lt;br&gt;Denmark likes California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>BTC dumping?

In 20 years I&amp;#x27;ll have the last laugh, you&amp;#x27;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873793&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873668&lt;br&gt;Right - but to repay debtors he has to dilute his baggie shareholders to zero. You always leave that part out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873802&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not his money tho, right? It&amp;#x27;s his investors&amp;#x27;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873812&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;Let me tell you how this shit works. Mstr is a front. It&amp;#x27;s a scheme that allows elite whales to cash out at the top. Fed money goes to Blackrock who buys mstr bonds. Mstr buys Bitcoin OTC from those in &amp;#x27;the club&amp;#x27;&lt;br&gt;There wouldn&amp;#x27;t be enough liquidity otherwise. &lt;br&gt;Noone actually buys mstr it&amp;#x27;s just an Epstein type operation to move money around and the goyim are too dumb to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873851&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873618&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saylor is well paid to launder funds through his “Bitcoin” management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
