Your average person is tens of thousands in credit card debt and struggling to pay off their klarna these days. Even worse, they&amp;#x27;re a few months behind on their mortgage and about to lose their house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, your lot go &amp;quot;WAAAAAA WOE IS ME I&amp;#x27;M ONLY WORTH $475K AT 23 YEARS OLD I&amp;#x27;LL NEVER BE RICH!!!!!&amp;quot; Even if you&amp;#x27;re larping, I mean fuck you don&amp;#x27;t&amp;#x27; realize how spoiled rotten and ridiculous you sound, you&amp;#x27;re not even funny nor cute when you whine like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883852&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;yea but crypto went down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883873&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;because im still a wageslave you retarded cockgargling faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883874&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;There are no 1st world countries anymore.

They are the group still spending in usa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884780&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;Another day another poorfag trying to drag me into his crab bucket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FUCK OFF YOU PIECE OF SHIT LOSER STOP TRYING TO MAKE EVERYONE SUFFER WITH YOU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884789&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884780&lt;br&gt;He isn’t wrong. American median household income is 60k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885028&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;Six figs isnt enough to retire. Anyways Im at very low 6 figs one slight dump in stocks and Im back to 5 figure hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want out of the wagecage and its not luck when the average person in the US probably buys fast food 10 times a week, goes out to a restuarant once a week at $200 per visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885045&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it called being tongue-and-cheek you stupid fucking retarded fucking nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885049&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885045&lt;br&gt;oops meet to say tongue in cheek but whatever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885051&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884789&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;median household income&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;household&lt;br&gt;Kek they try so hard to giving a realistic number. Show me median individual income, emphasis on median. Don&amp;#x27;t feed me &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; which is easily skewed upwards.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you live in a nation of 100 people&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;1 person makes $1b&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;99 people make $10k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;average houshold size is 10 people&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;median individual income $10k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;median household income $100k&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;average individual income ~$10m&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;average household income ~$100m&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885310&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885051&lt;br&gt;by your own math median is just as misleading as mean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885331&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;500k is nothing. If you have this, congrats. You can spend your entire net worth and buy a decent house. Now what? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has to be more than this, op. People who are &amp;quot;doing well&amp;quot; should be able to actually make a change in this world, yet they can barely afford to buy a house. The system is broken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885340&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885331&lt;br&gt;Back in muh day we just gathered sticks of wood and nailed cardboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;The majority of people in first world countries are boomers, they own multiple houses, have had multiple wives, multiple kids, multiple cars, multiple pension plans. I literally have nothing in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885360&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885350&lt;br&gt;Dont go there just stay where you are. When they send their drones china will just hack them and make them crash. And thats how the white cookie crumbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885501&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885310&lt;br&gt;But far more accurate to reality than the supposed reality they try to paint. In both median individual and household income the amounts are more accurate than average while median individual income bears the most accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885512&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m about to enter 6 figure hell next week, what am i in for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;My 300k is literally nothing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885562&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885512&lt;br&gt;5 figure hell after trump&amp;#x27;s tariff tirade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885855&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;Lucky? I&amp;#x27;m a fucking wage slave. Having 600k usd means fuck all when houses cost 2 million AUD in Sydney and I&amp;#x27;m 30 years old. I don&amp;#x27;t want to work the rest of my life (I won&amp;#x27;t anyway as AI is about to take me out)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885862&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885512&lt;br&gt;Depends on your age and savings rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885873&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;Nope. Not good enough.&lt;br&gt;Sense of accomplishment is relative. We want to go up in life, not down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885878&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883830&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s good that I was born when and where I was. It is a good thing. I greatly appreciate being born on a scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885983&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885051&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;what is law of large numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885987&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885331&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;muh house&lt;br&gt;Kys retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886585&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885512&lt;br&gt;Obsessively watching your portfolio everyday, and realizing you’re still broke. I eased off the gas and just started spending a little and enjoying life more when I hit 100k. If it’s gonna be another 30 years to retire, I might as well the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885350&lt;br&gt;Wait 50 years and you&amp;#x27;ll be even richer than boomers unless you fuck it up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886704&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885855&lt;br&gt;You can always rope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886984&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;over 500k at 32&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;165k safe public sector income&lt;br&gt;Never gonna make it ;_;&lt;br&gt;Forever angry at myself for buying the chainlink ICO and then selling before it mooned.&lt;br&gt;Shill me your shitcoins and meme stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Is it even possible to make it by opening a traditional business anymore? — 24 replies — 96.0/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61881439</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61881439?lm=1771778474</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 16:41:14 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Is it even possible to make it by opening a traditional business anymore?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61881439'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 24 • Updated: 2026-02-22 16:41 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read subject &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it even possible? Not only do you have to jump through a million regulations and fees just to get started, you&amp;#x27;re also competing against trillion dollar mega corps who can and will undercut you because they employ ten thousand indians and illegals who work for pennies. Even traditional blue collar jobs like plumbers and HVAC are all slowly coagulating into one single corporate entity (in my area), and basically every single mom and pop store was killed during COVID. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like the only way you can actually achieve anything is to basically trick angle investors into giving your bullshit tech start-up a ton of money or getting really lucky and have an app you make be bought out by a megacorp so they can rape your customers to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic unrelated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881439&lt;br&gt;Step 1: get a girlfriend&lt;br&gt;Step 2: have her start an ASMR channel on YouTube&lt;br&gt;Step 3: have her start a merchandise line on shopify&lt;br&gt;There.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881446&lt;br&gt;the pretty girl ASMR youtuber to OF is so undefeated..

The amount of bureaucracy involved to manage such a large entity is limiting in its own ways.&lt;br&gt;You have to find a niche that isn&amp;#x27;t currently being served in your market and then create a business for that.&lt;br&gt;For example: nobody is making catgirl gfs right now, it&amp;#x27;s a completely untapped market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882478&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corporations can now grow indefinetly due to advancement&amp;#x27;s in economic planning.

Can&amp;#x27;t have too many people escaping the wage cage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything is over regulated, because it means only mega corps have the resources to deal with the BS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883254&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881439&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;a million regulations and fees just to get started&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there are fees and regulations but they&amp;#x27;re not impossible to navigate, just look at how retardedness and drunkeness of the average trades small business owner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but you&amp;#x27;re right about consolidation and private equity ownership. there&amp;#x27;s no way around this, other than killing PE jews or the people who sell out to PE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881446&lt;br&gt;I did a similar thing with my wife&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;have gf&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;she films herself having sex with guys in college while we were long distance&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;both of us have cuckold fetish&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;whenever she visits me we usually set aside time for threesomes with guys we meet online and sex clubs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;eventually get married, start onlyfans where we film it all but blur the faces&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;make around $8000 a month &lt;br&gt;not a traditional business model as OP says however&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883298&lt;br&gt;disgusting freak. why marry at this point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883454&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s bait anon.

Commodity goods just aren&amp;#x27;t profitable when you have to compete by selling as close to zero margin as you can get, and make it up on volume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A company called Rare Breed is doing that right now in the field of &amp;quot;forced reset trigger systems&amp;quot; for firearms. Their projections are that they will make mid-eight figures of profit annually if they are the sole source. Note &amp;quot;profit&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;revenue&amp;quot;. Manufacturing costs on each of their units is probably around $50, and they&amp;#x27;re selling them for $500 each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difficulty: lots of infringers, including one batshit insane asshole from Arizona, and one kid who designed a free one that anyone can 3D print at home. (And in all fairness, the kid put it out on free 3D printing websites before several of Rare Breed&amp;#x27;s patents issued, but after they were filed, so he arguably wasn&amp;#x27;t even infringing at the time.) They&amp;#x27;ve got something like seventeen lawsuits going right now, IIRC, and some of the defendants are trying to get their cases consolidated into a single trial because of the expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s like getting into the in-game market in an MMO that&amp;#x27;s been around for 20 years, it&amp;#x27;s completely futile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884385&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881624&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882584&lt;br&gt;picrelated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884627&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course it is. Where do you think all these giant houses come from? There&amp;#x27;s tons of well-off business owners all throughout your city, state, country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886156&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884627&lt;br&gt;Most of whom got started a couple of generations ago. Then they set up legislative roadblocks to make it impossible for new competitors to spring up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My state requires a 1000 hour training certificate before someone can cut hair. As a result, a large percentage of those who do it are guys who were stuck in prison and learned their trade in the prison barbershop, because it was free for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886164&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884627&lt;br&gt;Oh, I forgot about the used car lots. Used to be that anyone could set up as a used car dealer. Then the big stealerships started getting outcompeted, with one big driver (heh) being because the independents would stay open on Sundays while the stealerships were closed. So the stealerships lobbied the legislature to prohibit used car lots from being open on Sundays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lots more similar stories in various businesses. Funeral parlors are heavily regulated (the excuse being &amp;quot;they can dispose of bodies in their crematoriums, so we have to regulate and license that profession&amp;quot;), and so on and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FFS in NYC Mamdani just asked for &amp;quot;volunteer snow shovelers&amp;quot; and demanded that they register with &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The City&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;#x27; by showing two forms of ID plus their Social Security card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886443&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886156&lt;br&gt;Reminds me of this&lt;br&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouP2qhTF3x4&lt;br&gt;In Oklahoma you need a funeral director&amp;#x27;s license to sell coffins&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;In order to become a licensed funeral director in Oklahoma, an individual must have a high school diploma or GED, complete a minimum two-year accredited mortuary science program, and pass the National Board Exam and the Oklahoma State Board of Mortuary Arts Exam. After completing the educational requirements, the individual must also complete a one-year apprenticeship in an Oklahoma funeral home. &lt;br&gt;All that just to sell a box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886977&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884346&lt;br&gt;Lol. No. It does not work like that. Only companies with in house lawyers benefit from patents, and they are mostly defensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61887004&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881439&lt;br&gt;Well, now is the time to start a business what with the new tariffs.&lt;br&gt;But it is not easy, and depending on your personality, may or may not be worth it. Judging from OPs attitude, its not worth it for him.&lt;br&gt;The path easiest for good money with least effort is to become a corporate drone. You gotta learn to speak the lingo and be agreeable and subservient. This is why they want a college degree.&lt;br&gt;Watch the movie &amp;quot;office space&amp;quot; for a comedic and yet canny take on corporate life.

But its not being celibate if your literally having sex. Such a weird term clearly carrying different meaning. What is the point of using a term that literally has no definition to its meaning, you might aswell speak in baby noises at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884146&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;guys, ALL we have to do is called women like this ugly chopped shit to their face as much as possible and they will lose all motivation to live&lt;br&gt;they are SO fragile in that regard.&lt;br&gt;next time you are walking down the street and see some bitch like this just start yelling “YOURE UGLY”&lt;br&gt;they will spend the next week and a half minimum making reddit posts about it and getting their SSRI prescription upped.&lt;br&gt;don’t ever engage with any ideas or thoughts they have. just pick apart their appearance. you look like a fridge and a stick insect at the same time. your fake dyed hair sucks. you have clown makeup on, you must have learned how to do makeup at the circus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884272&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883066&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re saying ceo&amp;#x27;s willingly burn 75% of their money for fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884291&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884272&lt;br&gt;he&amp;#x27;s saying the ceo is a fucking retard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884297&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;I want to shove my cock deep into the first one from behind. Just lift the skirt and blast the pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884717&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883784&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884737&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Without HR you could complete the work, banter and build a genuine camaraderie with your common co-worker, but we cant have unions, and its better if you&amp;#x27;re all divided and conquered, here&amp;#x27;s a harpy to make your life hell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884742&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873193&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872087&lt;br&gt;These niggers actually get it. All problems flow downstream from jews controlling the issuance of your (since 1913) fake and gay fiat debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885902&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;You must be over 18 to use this site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886326&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882442&lt;br&gt;Yeah this kind of mega über schizos who believe in fe and no nuke use this phrase holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61882442&lt;br&gt;And yes the idea of space is falsifiable you absolute schizo. Satellites wouldn&amp;#x27;t even work without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886359&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883784&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Such a weird term clearly carrying different meaning. What is the point of using a term that literally has no definition to its meaning&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s just people overusing words or ideas to oblivion, where they lose all context. It&amp;#x27;s like the worst insult was being called gay way back, then it was subverted (actually gay is cool), then it became retarded, then it got subverted (actually retarded is cool because you&amp;#x27;re not trying), then it become autistic, then it became subverted (actually it&amp;#x27;s interesting to be autistic), now it&amp;#x27;s random baby talk by gen alpha (mog, cortisol spike, chopped, unc, lil bro, frame, aura farming, 67, incel, cuk). Now it&amp;#x27;s being subverted by people overusing the terms even if they don&amp;#x27;t apply to anyone or anything in the context at all. Someone not having sex for a week = incel. Someone having a slightly embarrassing moment (cortisol spike), someone better looking walking past (mogged), doing something that&amp;#x27;s barely good (aura farming), having a strong presence even if it&amp;#x27;s completely autistic and retarded (frame). Or like when old people started wearing skateboard shirts having no clue what it was, or everyone and their dog wearing an off white shirt. People make shit gay eventually, it&amp;#x27;s a universal law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886363&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;work office job (engineer) with way too many women and diversity hire niggers and Indians who do nothing all day&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;get new (white) South African Vice President&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;calls us all together&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in his funny accent tells us he’s an engineer and knows the business and there will be changes&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tells us he will cut 20% of the workforce soon&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;everyone is shit scared and the normie femoids start climbing over each other trying to save their useless asses&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;office girlies start spreading rumours about everyone and everything in desperate attempt to make themselves look better&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;don’t give a fuck, I’m a technician and actually make money for the company unlike them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Vice President just observes the shit show and never comments on anything while he feels out the office&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;come in one Monday&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;literally all blacks are gone&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all except the actual useful Indians are gone&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he culled every single female that we all knew had jewish make believe adult daycare jobs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;only kept the old hag secretaries that actually do a great job&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kek, based white nigger. Turns out all it takes is some third world coloniser to clean this woke shit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886555&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;We are not capitalist.&lt;br&gt;We have been Trotskyist since the end of WW2.&lt;br&gt;Having a central bank is plank #5 of the commie manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886576&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61884742&lt;br&gt;It was a bit delayed until after 1913.&lt;br&gt;They couldn’t go full fakeconomy immediately, or they would have been shut down.&lt;br&gt;They had to wait and boil the frog slowly, using the occasional crisis as a speed boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t ever interact with HR once I&amp;#x27;m hired until I&amp;#x27;m inevitably fired. From where comes the HR hate? Are they the ones who actually make the decisions to fire us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886684&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;this board is dead as shit holy fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886687&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886684&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the weekend.

He&amp;#x27;s a media player and if you actually listened to some of his shit there does seem to be an interesting intersection between blockchain capabilities and homeownership etc...not financial advice of course just a variety of things I was peeking at when researching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61879999&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879836&lt;br&gt;What is your current occupation anon? Nothing revealing but in general etc...the exercise price of the warrants is $15...trading currently at less than a dollar it seems like a confusing deal...at this point if one likes the company wouldn&amp;#x27;t shares be the move? I did some modeling around warrant prices if the shares price goes to xyz and that is very interesting...also speaking of interesting what&amp;#x27;s the deal with the alleged cusip similarity to the old bbbyq shares?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61880091&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879999&lt;br&gt;Financial system. I am not asking you to hold those warrants until they are exercised. I am asking you to hold them and sell the warrants when we can realize a substantial profit. Nice quads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880091&lt;br&gt;Interesting. Wouldn&amp;#x27;t trading the warrants implicitly come with a short term capital gains tax insofar as its impossible to hold them over a year at this point? Would have to be some pretty fair gains to offset that 40% hit...anyways doesn&amp;#x27;t the warrants increasing in price also imply that the shares have gone up in price as well? I ran some informal modeling estimates using black scholes with iv, roughly .65 years to expiry and this is what I came up with: 15.5 bbby share price = 4.50ish warrant price...25 share price/12ish warrant price...60 share price/45ish warrant price...100 share price/85ish warrant price...200 share price 185ish warrant price...I make no claim as to the veracity of these numbers, just for fun. Anyways what do you see happening to the bbby stock price for these warrants to be worthwhile? Am I thinking on the right track in general?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881670&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881753&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879999&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881477&lt;br&gt;note the digis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881916&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;Buy these if you want, but remember, these warrants are not related to the canceled BBBYQ/DK-Butterfly, reguardless of what the BBBYQ schizos say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881980&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881916&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;nobody tell him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882152&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61879263&lt;br&gt;I hold a few&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882389&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;why are americans starting to invest more into VT?&lt;br&gt;isn&amp;#x27;t america the greatest country on earth?&lt;br&gt;for me it has always been VOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61882429&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;look at NPC holder distribution&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;there&amp;#x27;s no big dumps&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;base still present&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;conviction quietly intact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884950&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880091&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re allowed to buy warrants, won&amp;#x27;t your employer know you bought them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885366&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get ready everyone.

BTC is locked in a Bitcoin script where spending still requires the staker’s signature.

You bitcoin maxi retards need to wake up. Your 5k stack of crypto wont magically 100x in the next 5-10 years and make you rich lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878347&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61878072&lt;br&gt;Nah. I’ve already explained it a bunch. DYOR anon. Either let BTC sleep or look into native, self custody setups and pick what fits you kek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61878349&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869514&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the elites&lt;br&gt;There are many kinds of elites that compete against each other.

They&amp;#x27;ll have some do nothing hedge fund manager position open for 40 million a year they give to their polo buddy&amp;quot; and she is like &amp;quot;How do you get from having lunch with someone to that!!&amp;quot; and im like &amp;quot;.....well it&amp;#x27;s basically a gang&amp;quot; and she continues to reeeee and not understand basic social dynamics or the way high levels of corporate business work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW she literally was born in the same year as Epstein in Queens literally probably within walking distance of his old haunts, she has said she probably knows some of the people that knew him. Her grandfather was also very well connected and wealthy and worked in Manhattan and was born in the same year as Fred Trump in Queens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Women, especially boomer women, are so helpless in serious business. They have been lied to their entire lives that you just build a resume and &amp;quot;network&amp;quot; with people. Not that high level corporate America is literally blood in blood out inner city gang mentality.

I&amp;#x27;ll game and goon basically for free and I pay no rent so monthly costs are basically $200 a month after factoring in taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886155&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886095&lt;br&gt;by double cheeseburgers do you mean mcdoubles, i thought those were 1 dollar each&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885522&lt;br&gt;40k, plus occasionally I&amp;#x27;ll splurge a few times a year and buy a new car or trade up my yacht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886189&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886155&lt;br&gt;They have double cheese as well. McDouble is two patties but only one slice of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886544&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;is 2K a month enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886155&lt;br&gt;the mcdouble is literally the best most efficient food they have at McD&amp;#x27;s I never ever order anything else there&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know how they NEVER advertise the mc double? Makes you think huh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886575&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885522&lt;br&gt;would also like to know, if shtf in europe then i might have to go to there. is $5000 per month enough in California?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886623&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61885522&lt;br&gt;About $55k/yr or just over $4.5k/month for me and my wife (f). About $15k/y is burned by property taxes and various insurances. Most of that $55k is covered by social security, the rest from investments. We&amp;#x27;ve got a bit over $2.5m in various 401k/IRA/Roth/brokerage accounts, and the 4% guideline works out to about $100k/yr that we could safely spend from those accounts, so occasional large expenses (new roof, A/C replacement, new car) aren&amp;#x27;t really a concern. We didn&amp;#x27;t have to change our lifestyle when we retired - once the house was paid for and the kids out of the house then our expenses dropped pretty dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886632&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886544&lt;br&gt;Maybe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886736&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886623&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;How much would you say you spend on necessities just for yourself and do you live in a HCOL area?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886796&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61886736&lt;br&gt;I live in Dallas, so moderately expensive I guess. My brother lives in Bossier La, and many things are a fair bit cheaper there.&lt;br&gt;As for necessities were I single, I suspect it&amp;#x27;s probably about 2/3 to 3/4 of the cost for the 2 of us. Not all expenses halve when you&amp;#x27;re single. Gas and utilities don&amp;#x27;t halve, for example, nor does housing. And while Groceries theoretically *should*, in practice it&amp;#x27;s just as inconvenient to cook for 1 as it is for 2 - but with half the help and half the benefit, which is one reason a lot of singles (retired or not) tend to eat out more or use doordash or similar, destroying most of the potential savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>CRYPTO IS DEAD — 30 replies — 7.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61880718</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61880718?lm=1771764309</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 12:45:09 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;CRYPTO IS DEAD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61880718'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 30 • Updated: 2026-02-22 12:45 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crypto is dead. So I&amp;#x27;m looking into buying again, maybe lump sum maybe DCA. What do you think, anons? Some think that the bear market is just starting so maybe it&amp;#x27;s better to wait... but idk, the sentiment seems rather depressed already. Anyone else also accumulating rn or ar you waiting for october?

My instinct tells me this year is going to be really bad for crypto. Lots of crashing, crabbing, doom and gloom. So I&amp;#x27;ll slurp up as much bloody water as I can and hope that in the next few years we either finish collapsing or I&amp;#x27;m incredibly wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61881505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;I voted for this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883131&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881187&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s not true, pic related is the covid dip. You had a total of 5 days at 5k, then it started a pretty steep recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883135&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61881266&lt;br&gt;Pretty much this, except things will probably turn suddenly when CLARITY passes in a month or 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883290&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883135&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Polity is going to make my bag go line up&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;BUY MY BAG NOW&lt;br&gt;no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883380&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;btc behaves like a more volatile leveraged spy. I thought the whole idea is crypto being a hedge against fiat and being decentralized. now american companies like mstr and blackrock own huge chunks and the whole crypto movement depends on american regulations. I dont own crypto and I never will. Everyone still being heavily into crypto at this moment must be desperate as fuck otherwise I dont get it. Last 5 years btc couldnt even outperform the s&amp;amp;p lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883384&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883380&lt;br&gt;Everyone being into ponzi asset, including every single ponzi paper in the spx is desperate &lt;br&gt;You can&amp;#x27;t print yourself out of a demographic deflation.

Are you fucking retarded?&lt;br&gt;Yeah I don&amp;#x27;t play chicken with assets, I DCA when there&amp;#x27;s fear and I sell when there&amp;#x27;s greed.&lt;br&gt;Once again, not buying your bags, nigger.&lt;br&gt;Sold my silver @103 as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883782&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883631&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;like AI&lt;br&gt;buying ai here is about the most retarded investment strategy possible&lt;br&gt;ai credit is cracking all over the place and the mag 7 are going to spend 90% of their revenue on capex this year&lt;br&gt;who is left to incinerate trillions of dollars now, we are about to hit the minsky moment on the ai build out&lt;br&gt;considering the regular economy isnt doing too badly might not even be bad for other assets as the retarded overspend on infrastructure build out is curtailed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and also this isnt even touching on the rather hard physical limits that even if they keep exponentially building more datacenters there doesnt exist the electricity surplus to actually turn the things on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The value of a company is based on its ability to split its profits between its owners, aka shareholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is the value of Bitcoin based on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61883974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;Brics, Banks and Billionaires only buying one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The value of a company is based on its ability to split its profits between its owners, aka shareholders.&lt;br&gt;lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61884025&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;Did crypto ever have life in the first place? When you consider the (((forces))) at play behind normalizing CBDCs and tokenization of everything - the entire crypto concept becomes just another homosexual ponzi used to control people, track their purchases, and control their rates in order to reward the good goyim, and punish the bad. Unbacked digital tokens on a screen never had any value to begin with. Some people still think the jew.s. dollar has value even though it is literally unbacked and printable monopoly game board paper. It&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;VALUE&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; comes from the jew.s. AIPAC government forcing its usage through tyranny and semitic organizations like the FED. Unbacked paper that the state prints could never be an actual wealth instrument, just fake currency for a fake economy in a fake two-party &amp;quot;&amp;quot;democratic&amp;quot;&amp;quot; nation. Press S to spit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61885137&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61883631&lt;br&gt;What if I am doing the same thing that always worked and expecting the same result too? Buying assets that &amp;quot;have momentum&amp;quot; is just a different way to say you&amp;#x27;re buying tops, it&amp;#x27;s a retarded strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61886530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61880718&lt;br&gt;If you didn&amp;#x27;t make it in 2021 or 2017 you are ngmi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto needs a major flush out reset or its cooked for good this time. I have never been more bearish for the future of crypto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
