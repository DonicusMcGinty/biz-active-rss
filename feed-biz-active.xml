Unfortunately hoeflation and unrealistic expectations, combined with chinese men having a &amp;quot;no roasties&amp;quot; policy for women over 25 means that chicks act like bitchy little whores when they&amp;#x27;re teens, chasing millionaire chink ceo dick, then they get kicked to the curb when they wall and film videos of themselves crying that no man will even hold their hand.

It feels infinite, especially after all the QE, but there are no dollars &amp;#x27;locked up&amp;#x27; in stocks. Someone is physically holding those dollars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the mindset changes, suddenly the liquidity is gone. The rug is pulled.

Expecting Chinese to stop subsidising their industry is akin to asking Americans to stop eating Burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875528&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875497&lt;br&gt;Huh no kidding, I hadn’t been paying much attention to that. One thing I will be keeping an eye on is the EU pension crisis and how that’s managed because I personally don’t see a smooth exit from that situation, especially in France. Looking into it, I guess Germany has a similar problem, which I wouldn’t have guessed based on their debt. What’s your take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875121&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s between 6 and 8 Yuan so it&amp;#x27;s still tied to the dollar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875517&lt;br&gt;Well, my point was that by managing the currency in order to keep it low, it makes exports more attractive, which results in a huge surplus. If the yuan floated freely, this would eventually correct. A huge trade surplus would mean more demand for the yuan and it would strengthen the currency. However, China doesn’t let this happen. If the currency strengthens or threatens to strengthen beyond what they deem desirable, they weaken their currency by selling yuan or by setting a lower daily exchange rate. This is the advantage of a managed currency, but it also means that it pisses everyone off when their own exports aren’t as competitive or their domestic industries suffer. China claims that they don’t this to the extent that they’re accused of, and it definitely comes in waves of egregiousness, but it seems like they’re back at it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, it’s true they’re good at exporting, but their insane trade surplus is in part the result of what I’m describing (an undervalued yuan that is kept undervalued by china’s central bank).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875564&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873590&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;call western &amp;quot;social democracies&amp;quot; capitalist&lt;br&gt;We are 10 times more communist than china... with an extra helping of suicidal democracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875527&lt;br&gt;China doesn&amp;#x27;t subsidize their industries though&lt;br&gt;They just do things better and have more affordable standards of living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875583&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873819&lt;br&gt;Wtf I love China now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875617&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875554&lt;br&gt;It can be undervalued and tied to the dollar. Read my post. You seem to think that because a currency’s exchange rate hasn’t changed that it can’t be undervalued or overvalued. That’s not true. Its real value in terms of purchasing power could rise and the central bank could artificially exert downward pressure (which would mean that the exchange rate would stay roughly the same over time). This is exactly what China has been accused of forever, and the issue is that China issue exactly forthcoming with their economic data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is obviously tied to the dollar. It is not STRICTLY PEGGED to the dollar. Every day the PBOC sets the exchange rate. The argument is that this rate hasn’t changed and has remained too low for how much demand there is for the yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875625&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875528&lt;br&gt;Well they&amp;#x27;re definitely going to bail the pension system out, but it should be kind of mitigated by the military and infrastructure spending because of their domestic industry. Adding money to those sectors should hypothetically cause more younger people to make more money, increasing direct contributions to the pension system. The bet that they&amp;#x27;re taking is that the spending won&amp;#x27;t increase inflation as much as it will improve the economic situation, which has some merit because Germany and even the rest of the EU have considerably lower debt to GDP than China or the US, and the currency has been appreciating broadly over the past few years giving them room for increased spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875629&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875572&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of them are subsidised. They do not call them as subsidies but different names. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: Ran a Business sourcing products from multiple suppliers in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875657&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873690&lt;br&gt;A communist dictator that values his people and his country will absolutely make any system built on jewish corruption look bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875675&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875625&lt;br&gt;Interesting, good take. Definitely a situation to watch, particularly how the bailout happens. Getting a handle on youth unemployment, especially in France, should help, yeah. Realistically, I wonder if the pension system will be continued for much longer moving forward, and I think the French will lose their shit if it’s reformed in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876788&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;China now rises to take the world stage because the west was reckless and retarded with their wealth. They relied on Chinas cheap exports too much and now suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876792&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875124&lt;br&gt;Yes, the pride comes before the fall. As it always has throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875563&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an interesting theory that borders on coping strategy because it makes currency seem much more important than the worthless shit it is. Yuan floating or not floating does not change the fact that China manufactures everything that&amp;#x27;s not manufactured elsewhere. The currency that is used in the exchange of goods does not change that fact. The unfloating of yuan would not teleport all the CNC mills, supply chains, and millions of workers into Tennessee or Germany. Currency can ligma balls or be infinitely expensive compared to other currencies, it does not matter. It may seem that it does, but it does not. Fixed currency makes exchange of goods easier, and manufacturers can plan more easily. Exchange rates are annoying, that&amp;#x27;s true. China eliminated that headache. It&amp;#x27;s a right decision, but nowhere near the most important decision they made to be the best at everything that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876956&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874655&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the US can literally print the oil price into the ground&lt;br&gt;it can&amp;#x27;t actually. Picrel. Being able to produce 70% of the all physical things on Earth give you the ability to print whatever you want WITHOUT inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876956&lt;br&gt;midwit take. they avoid inflation by having an iron grip on capital flows. they essentially cheat the impossible trinity model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877067&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877010&lt;br&gt;in that case, why don&amp;#x27;t North Korea/Cuba/Russia print 1 trillion dollars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877115&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875572&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875564&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874440&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sincerely hope you&amp;#x27;re just too young or pol-brained to know any better, but just in case you aren&amp;#x27;t:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chinese state does not give out money (or make sure other financiers are available to give out money) in order to create productive, competitive industry. They do it for 2 reasons:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It lets them massively overproduce a good (solar panels, EVs, E-bikes, ect...) at a loss in order to crush foreign manufacturing bases and corner the production&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;It helps ensure employment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the reason for the boondoggle that has been OBOR is that it meant the Chinese could use central Asia as a dumping ground for all of the dogshit concrete and steel they were churning out at a loss for years. There wasn&amp;#x27;t an appetite for that much material when they were making it, and they knew it. Export profits were not the point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2nd point is the bigger deal. Basically, for a long time, the deal in China was that so long as the average guy could get a job if he wanted one, and didn&amp;#x27;t make too much noise, things would get better. The CCP revolution that conquered the country was built on jobless, angry people, and the guys running the CCP did not want to be on the other end of that deal. Therefore, the CCP is willing to subsidize terrible business that are guaranteed to lose money, so long as they can promise jobs. The problem these days is that youth unemployment is high and climbing and the increasingly small share of the Chinese population that is young is more and more dissatisfied with living in a PvE server as the E.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;61876817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;best at everything that matters&lt;br&gt;What a funny way to say, &amp;quot;polluted their soil, water, and air so thoroughly that not even their party members are able to avoid bone marrow cancer anymore.&amp;quot; You would think that they would just incinerate the waste solvents from all the REE processing like Victorian industrialists, but I guess it was 0.000003 RMB cheaper per ton to just dump it into the nearest waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877159&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877115&lt;br&gt;Ameri fat Kool aid&lt;br&gt;USAID mental gymnastics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877162&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877115&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;OBOR boondoggle&lt;br&gt;opinion discarded.

We&amp;#x27;re talking about a place that has regular catastrophic flooding on a river its people have continually inhabited and farmed for over 3000 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They will scream, they will cry, they will seethe&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but they will never talk about ROI on that rail road/highway combo that was supposed to cross the most economically desolate strip of earth possible to connect &amp;quot;where?&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;who cares?&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;A country that still cannot manage to make etchants more complicated than RCA cleans is gonna totally dominate semiconductors &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The really fun environmental whoopsie they did recently was related to cadmium and arsenic uptake. Cotton was being grown in fields contaminated with heavy metals, which is relatively fine since the fibers won&amp;#x27;t get consumed. Then the order came down to convert cotton fields to grain. The only reason that anyone noticed a problem is that cadmium poisoning causes rapid onset joint pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But none of that can top the hilarity of deleting literally millions of infants between 1980 and 2015, then turning around and being utterly shocked at running out of young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877210&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61877206&lt;br&gt;we&amp;#x27;re talking about the only place that can make hdmi cables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877217&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cotton fields&lt;br&gt;are all in Xinjiang, which btw produces the absolute best cotton in the world. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;growing grains in Xinjiang&lt;br&gt;ror&lt;br&gt;rmao even&lt;br&gt;do you even read what you wrote and see how retarded you sound?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;environmental protection&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;in 2026&lt;br&gt;Are we really going to pretend that this matters at all anymore? Look at who&amp;#x27;s the fucking president. Look at what he&amp;#x27;s doing to the EPA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if Europe wants to have competitive manufacturing again, they&amp;#x27;ll likely lax regulations too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t like it either, a lot of people are going to get fucked. However competitive manufacturing means slashing prices, which means ignoring everything that doesn&amp;#x27;t show up on a quarterly report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877619&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872964&lt;br&gt;Instead of wasting money on niggers, China subsidizes real businesses that make things?&lt;br&gt;IMF Jews are seething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877897&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876817&lt;br&gt;I am not arguing that China doesn’t produce essential goods. I am trying to explain how these conditions happened. While there are tons of reasons that Chinese manufacturing rose to prominence—huge cheap labor force that was previously kept away from foreign investment, America putting China on the MFN list—a consistently cheap currency is one of them, hence why they have been accused of currency manipulation for literal decades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Currency can ligma balls or be infinitely expensive compared to other currencies, it does not matter. It may seem that it does, but it does not.&lt;br&gt;This is just patently untrue. Obviously, if China’s currency were infinitely expensive, which would be the equivalent to having a self-imposed trade embargo, nobody would buy their products. What you would see is the rapid expansion of the industries that China has a monopoly on; a part of the reason that these industries do not pop up elsewhere is that potential manufacturers know that it’s difficult to compete with how cheap Chinese goods are, so why bother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You seem to genuinely believe that exchange rates do not ultimately matter in trade, which simply ignores how international trade functions. I’ll give you another example. After WWII, the US set Japan’s exchange rate intentionally low as a part of the Dodge Plan because they wanted a democratic stronghold in Asia, and they knew giving them a cheaper currency would help their export market. This worked TOO WELL. Over the course of the next forty years, Japan became so dominant in the export market that other countries began to panic and they “renegotiated” the exchange rate again at the plaza accords (this would have disastrous effects). If we were in the 80’s, you would point to Japan and say that “look at all the great products they make. It doesn’t matter what their exchange rate is,” and that would ignore the conditions that gave rise to their export dominance in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us? — 80 replies — 115.6/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796?lm=1771586313</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:18:33 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Is it really that much more difficult to start a business in the eu than us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61860796'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 80 • Updated: 2026-02-20 11:18 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys in the EU make less than us on paychecks, but you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare and PTO while we have to pay for private insurance which chronically denies people&amp;#x27;s health situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are people saying that starting a business in the EU is difficult because of the regulations? What regulations does the European union impose on its citizen&amp;#x27;s than they think it&amp;#x27;s easier to start in the United States instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Depends enormously on which country are we talking about. Some are easy (Germany) some are very hard (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860817&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you get to keep more of your money because you have universal healthcare&lt;br&gt;yeah right&lt;br&gt;good luck getting that &amp;quot;universal healthcare&amp;quot; if you&amp;#x27;re not a boomer, waiting lists are years for even a basic exam/procedure. It&amp;#x27;s either you go private (and pay out of your own pocket) or you die&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; and PTO&lt;br&gt;oh wow, 20 wagie cagie free days a year. Totally worth the 60%+ taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All taxation is theft. It&amp;#x27;s just that. Taxation doesn&amp;#x27;t pay for services. It&amp;#x27;s just the way they control the economy, and here in EU they fucking LOVE to control what you can and cannot do. They print the money, they don&amp;#x27;t need to tax you. They tax you to control you (and to humiliate you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61860822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;The healthcare thing is too much american leftie argument, it also has been very overcrowded by you guessed arabs and africans, unironically I was better treated when I broke my leg in brazil of all places then in france&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870744&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870065&lt;br&gt;it started long before post-WW2 tho, germs bureaucracymaxxed post-reunification during the 2nd Reich, from 1871 onward.&lt;br&gt;At first it was to keep in check all the landers trying to take the lion&amp;#x27;s share of federal credits and centralize power. And it worked gud, but then it progressively became the hellscape kafkaian machine we all know.&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s how you know the hallofcost never happened, becuz you can be sure nazis would have made endless paperworks addressing the situation, down to the very last jewish pubic hair, but we didn&amp;#x27;t find any document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop eating the commie propaganda. Europeans don&amp;#x27;t have savings for shit, they just have stable expenses but all their wealth is tied to inheriting homes. That&amp;#x27;s why homes are basically untaxed while stocks are treated like financial Nazism. You aren&amp;#x27;t going to spend more a healthy young person in the US, the real benefit of Europe is the private healthcare is very cheap and good &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting businesses in Europe sucks because of two factors. The first is low liquidity and consumer spending: unlike the US, people don&amp;#x27;t spend nearly as much, have as much to spend, or make debt. So there isn&amp;#x27;t much room for anyone to buy something new - successful businesses target liquid tourists or B2B, where they write off the huge taxes as expenses. Over regulated financial market also leads to lower liquidity and more difficulty getting loans and investors, you rely on government programs run by middle aged menopausal cunts that have never worked more than 28 hours a week &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other issue is labor laws and public perception. It&amp;#x27;s morally bankrupt to try and get more money, why aren&amp;#x27;t you happy being average, why are you trying to pull ahead. Anyone you hire can&amp;#x27;t be fired, you can&amp;#x27;t have low compensation with offset packages to get high skill labor, you need to suck some blue blooded cock to get money and not wait years for whatever permits you&amp;#x27;ll need, because they were born out of nobility and still have half the money and connections &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eurotards freak out about Epstein but every European politician and rich person rapes babies for breakfast. It&amp;#x27;s just 1) not pedo to them if they&amp;#x27;re over 14 bc muh age of consent and 2) they hide in the shadows unlike Americans, they try to be as unnoticed as possible, give a few concessions to the poor and continue ruling sucking and fucking like they&amp;#x27;ve been doing the past thousand years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870889&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870103&lt;br&gt;What are the reforms that boomers are blocking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870915&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869942&lt;br&gt;Yeah i feel the same. Sex, drugs and love are already the ultimate sensations and none of them are expensive. All luxuries are pretty worthless add-ons and don’t feel special. You just have a bigger bed, or a bigger car, not anything you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870937&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860817&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s complete bullshit, stop making up fantasies in your mind. If there is ONE thing still somewhat running smoothly in western Europe, it&amp;#x27;s free healthcare.&lt;br&gt;Contrary to you i know what i&amp;#x27;m talking about since i was on the operation table just a month ago to fix few lower vertebrae after a bike accident. I never had to wait for anything more than few days, nor did i have to spend a single penny on pre-procedures, examinations or for the hospital stay/operation/anesthesia/post-op medication. And i don&amp;#x27;t have any health mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It probably would have costed me a bazillion goybux in the jewSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870937&lt;br&gt;Why the fuck would it cost bajillions, even shit insurance has a max out of pocket of like 10k. If you don&amp;#x27;t have a job medicaid literally covers everything for free, the real problem is half the people that qualify are too fucking stupid to sign up for it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also if the accident wasn&amp;#x27;t your fault you could sue for big money, in Europe they&amp;#x27;re just like meh accidents happen enjoy the lifelong complications faggot. I will agree southern European health systems are pretty decent and their private healthcare is fantastic and cheap, but if you&amp;#x27;re German or some shit I&amp;#x27;d rather have the US system, you guys pay more in healthcare tax than any American if you have a half decent job and if you get anything where you may actually die they just say, yeah you&amp;#x27;re fucked settle your affairs or the bureaucracy will give the rest of your family a stroke, no point trying any more it&amp;#x27;s an inefficient allocation of resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868041&lt;br&gt;This is extremely short-sighted of them, they will end up losing the capacity to compete and fall behind slowly, they actually already are, then when they slowly go on closing business left and right from ever increasing ineficiency. What else can they even do but borrow more and more for the worst possible spending a state can do, paying bills, a budget blackhole, increasing inflation and making money useless and as those countries get poorer the services will also get far far far worse and extremely corrupt, not even talking about how such aging will make it even worse. Honestly this is reading like what happened to argentina, greece and other latam and thirdies socialist govts did, it will work fine as long as the economy can keep it, when it starts to shrink it will be poverty hell. I will agree that america treats us workers pretty bad, but this welfare paradise of the EU won&amp;#x27;t work for long either, they will end up forced to cut things and get closer to us if they want to survive a world with China, India, US and former colonies being no longer mudhutts but mildly developed enough to make raw resources more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;Lots of retards ITT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Setting up a business is child&amp;#x27;s play in places like Denmark, Sweden, Estonia. Setting up, doing tax returns and all interactions with gov is handled through online ID and takes seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Places like Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia are selling themselves as business friendly. Very low taxes. Some places like Bulgaria have extremely low dividend taxes so you pay yourself with dividends. Romania has a corporate setup where you pay a tiny percentage on the turnover. Ideal for freelancers or small business with high margins or just extreme low expense. In all of these places, corporate setups and accountants cost next to nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you have some almost offshore jurisdictions still in the EU with insanely beneficial rules for some niches and very low taxes. Like Cyprus and Malta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now regulations, what regulations? Anything (except guns, booze, some gambling, cigarettes I guess) is traded freely between the states under the same legislation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also: we get sued way less over here. Do the math on that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871050&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; wife started selling her paintings&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; she declared herself first, this was needed to attend some events&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; French government instantly asks her for €800, before she has made her first sale&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; this is what they estimate she&amp;#x27;d owe them at the end of the year based on their estimates of how much she will earn, so they ask for it upfront&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; you can contest it but it&amp;#x27;s actually faster to wait for the year to end so they are proven wrong&lt;br&gt;I hate them so much...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871051&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860860&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;taxes&lt;br&gt;depends where, some places will legit rape your revenue&lt;br&gt;Combined with some insane regulations and you legit can&amp;#x27;t start a company&lt;br&gt;Best example is France, fucked up taxes, and if you want to get into tech, or anything that involves personal data, you need cough up 6 to 7 figures so that your cyber security is in the norm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860815&lt;br&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871111&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;I will die long before I see some high tech company or even mid tier industry appear in latam, africa or even india, they will always be turning up cheap raw resources because they are simply brown subhumans with low iq, not even talking about russia post-war. Its an unfounded fearmongering that we will ever have to compete with them lol, you forget europe will never fall to thirdie level of mismanagement simple because we are better educated and white. At the very worst unlikely scenario we will always make money from tourism anyway, but honestly this is all american envy for no reason, we are not stopping you from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871116&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871023&lt;br&gt;So you&amp;#x27;re admitting you can only live off arbitrage? Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria, Romania is actually marginally based because it&amp;#x27;s spread its asshole to US companies for cheap EU labor, those Nordic countries you listed have a smaller economy than Pennsylvania so yeah if you want to sell troon support stickers you&amp;#x27;re good but you&amp;#x27;re not going to make shit otherwise &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portugal is also kind of based but it fully relies on US and other European investments, as well as inexistent enforcement of labor laws and pathetic salaries. I don&amp;#x27;t get how you&amp;#x27;d start up there without the first 100k being gifted though, or the family having land, or working abroad first &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire opening a bakery or car wash or hamster fentanyl university of arts like the US, there&amp;#x27;s no consumer spending to eat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871180&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Europe is only viable for tourism or B2B, you will never become a millionaire&lt;br&gt;Lmao, just look at economic charts, most european economies have high tech industry as the main economic activity, american bullshit as usual, nobody needs to be a millionaire in europe, we already live better than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871116&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Who the fuck are you selling to in Romania or Bulgaria,&lt;br&gt;As I said, you are a fucking retard. Your company is in Bulgaria, but you sell to fucking anyone in EU the same way while paying insanely low corporate tax and next to no admin fees. You ship from anywhere you want in the EU, or have staff in bloody Manila if you wish. What the fuck does that have to do with arbitrage? You incorporate wherever you want since it is your legal right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doubt you are entrepreneurial material though, so do not bother grokking the potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871191&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871000&lt;br&gt;The suing thing is the biggest AIDS of USA. People are already well compensated enough in europe for their troubles. The ”if you make a honest mistake, someone will see their opportinity and sue you and financially destroy your life” mentality just creates even more stress to an already high stress environment of USA. It just makes people act even more legally defensive at every turn and creates useless bureucracy and slows things down. Getting raped when everything didn’t go 100% nicely is not something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871020&lt;br&gt;This is the most midwit take and the reason why USA is failing now (it has become a nation of midwits due to poor public education). People have been saying this for decades but right now europe is in a bullrun while USA has been becoming an oligarchic brasil since the 80s. Clearly socialism doesn&amp;#x27;t just lead to inefficiency but instead to more efficiency for all instead of just few hoarding the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871353&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871183&lt;br&gt;Learn to read Fritz, you are saying what I&amp;#x27;m saying while sounding like a mong. You&amp;#x27;re setting up in poor countries to sell to richer countries&amp;#x27; businesses while using the common market, it&amp;#x27;s geographic arbitrage you sausage guzzling troon, and you&amp;#x27;re selling to businesses. All that free education and you&amp;#x27;re still poorer than a fucking car salesman in Pensacola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871500&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871214&lt;br&gt;What? Excluding Pooland all major eu economies have stopped growing or deacelerated fast, people were saying it for decades with reason, if it wasnt for a miraculous fall of the ussr and a flood of cheap raw resources and energy with negligible transport costs from russia it would&amp;#x27;ve happened earlier as it did post-2008 when europe started to lag more and more behind the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61867554&lt;br&gt;Nigger&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;give us taxes goy&lt;br&gt;ok, well, how much&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;We don&amp;#x27;t know uwu&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;you tell us&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but if you&amp;#x27;re wrong we get to take even more of your money lol&lt;br&gt;you just said you don&amp;#x27;t know what I owe&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thats right &lt;br&gt;so how do you know if I pay wrong?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Don&amp;#x27;t get cheeky with us you little shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871570&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871500&lt;br&gt;That guy is fucking retarded why even argue. The average European is still a moron, printing useless degrees doesn&amp;#x27;t make people smarter. They still cuck themselves daily. He&amp;#x27;s happy to never own anything so his blue blooded friends can hoard the land and wealth like they&amp;#x27;ve always done &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Muh healthcare muh taxes &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half of every country is too fucking poor to pay tax, and the top 10% isn&amp;#x27;t stupid enough to pay tax, so the middle class just pays 50% of their income while being happy they can rent a shit hole for life and that they&amp;#x27;re better off unemployed than working in terms of life quality &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will definitely return to Europe once my nest egg is built, I&amp;#x27;ll just live in 2 different countries 179 days a year and live off US divvies therefore paying no retard tax and just paying private healthcare out of pocket, or if I really make it just pay the flat 100k Italian tax and get private insurance for 300 a month that will pay for top quality coverage while I sip Italian wines and hire high end eastern european hookers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871624&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871570&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;can’t get women otherwise so has to pay for hookers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for revealing that you’re some dysfunctional weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871681&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871624&lt;br&gt;Thanks for showing why you&amp;#x27;re weak, religious morals won&amp;#x27;t get you anywhere. Also very europilled, way more Europeans use hookers than Americans outside the lower class - but you pretend like it&amp;#x27;s somehow weird while you haven&amp;#x27;t even been to church since your communion &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now I bang for free, outside working and life only about one chick a week, but you bet your ass I&amp;#x27;ll buy some dimes when I can live off passive income, at least they&amp;#x27;re safe and making good money unlike the daughters you gave away to arabs to be beaten and bred to show how woke you are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871776&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many countries are gatekept by language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871778&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860796&lt;br&gt;People are doing a lot of grifting and lobby work for deregulation. Starting a business isn&amp;#x27;t really difficult.&lt;br&gt;There are some bad things, in Germany for example financing rounds require a notary to read out the whole contract in person to you. But a lot of these things you and 90% of small business owners won&amp;#x27;t encounter in practice&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61860837&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;tax system is so incredibly fucking complex you have to hire people just to calculate how much you own&lt;br&gt;You legitimately think accountants only exist in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873866&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61868110&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not bullshit. Europeans are smart. The European rich just refused to pay programmers so any good programmer went to America over the past 35 fucking years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am right now in the middle of an administrative process in spain which through no error on my side has taken a cumulative 60 - 70 legal work hours to solve for a license for a business unit that generates 15k € in revenue per annum &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;you tell me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871776&lt;br&gt;Shouldn&amp;#x27;t you be good if you speak English and French?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876041&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol. Lmao.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine not living in an offshore tax haven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have roads with no potholes and public schools. Hospitals. Low crime and comfy prisons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matter of fact, what do you mainlanders get for your tax burden? Other than replacement migration, high crime and crumbling public infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877858&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873866&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Europeans are smart.&lt;br&gt;They used to be. Not anymore.&lt;br&gt;There are regions in European G7 nations, in which just short of a majority of kids can&amp;#x27;t properly read by age 14. You&amp;#x27;ve got people with senior high school diploma, that can&amp;#x27;t fucking write for shit.&lt;br&gt;All for the ultimate goal of &amp;quot;equality&amp;quot;. That clearly didn&amp;#x27;t work by making the &amp;quot;disenfranchised&amp;quot; smarter, so they make the majority of kids retarded instead, so retards stop being a minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>the US is in recession — 45 replies — 112.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61869320</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61869320?lm=1771587360</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:36:00 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;the US is in recession&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61869320'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 45 • Updated: 2026-02-20 11:36 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;the US is in recession&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869343&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;doomed fag nation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869350&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adjust by population&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61869389&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870844&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;We should all build steel furnances in our backyard for glorious leader trump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61870845&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;Too bad Biden got the definition of recession changed by websters and wikipedia the day we entered one back in 2022.

Delivering Pizzas though was working with friends and we would smoke pot and drink beers, didn&amp;#x27;t feel like work really.&lt;br&gt;This was in the aftermath of 2008, during 2009/10 I did that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872563&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869517&lt;br&gt;3 days a week is not a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872729&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870872&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;think&lt;br&gt;*know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872903&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870845&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;defining a recession by the fucking dictionary&lt;br&gt;stupid nigger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872909&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it&amp;#x27;s been in recession since two thousand fucking eight &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;they just can&amp;#x27;t hide it anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872927&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872563&lt;br&gt;36+ hours is a full time job, retard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874552&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am one of those assholes.

Seriously you can&amp;#x27;t ask for a raise and give me one of your jobs? Then you mock me for failing to get a job? You are hogging 2 jobs. If you didn&amp;#x27;t work 2 jobs there would be room for unemployed people to have jobs too. Boomer X fuckers still don&amp;#x27;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61870808&lt;br&gt;I hope you’re trolling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877277&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869343&lt;br&gt;as long as wagies keep waging, it aint doomed nigga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869320&lt;br&gt;People are working two or more jobs and you call this recession? Fucking hilarious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877311&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876310&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876213&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;SING UP FOR&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;like places are just a great volunteer association and not a rigorous shittest from hr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877894&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61869507&lt;br&gt;There are 7 days a week anon. If you consider a 40 hour week a full time job, then an 80 hour week is two full time jobs. That&amp;#x27;s under 12 hours a day, every day. Plus commutes to the two jobs, you are out of home 13 to 14 hours. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876213&lt;br&gt;99% larpers, 1% get caught after on-boarding period&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876139&lt;br&gt;Other than fast food, I doubt people who work 80 hour weeks even have time to spend their money on bullshit. They probably just shower and collapse to bed at the end of the day. My bet is that they are paying a mortgage or have an incapacitated spouse or parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877899&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;if the US is in recession, why did Doordash just have it&amp;#x27;s biggest ever jump in orders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>why would anyone live here — 79 replies — 101.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797?lm=1771586001</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:13:21 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;why would anyone live here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872797'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 79 • Updated: 2026-02-20 11:13 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;i recently moved to NYC to work for a &amp;quot;lucrative salary&amp;quot; (not really, because this place drains you of all your income) and after working here for 4 months i dont know why anyone would willingly live here&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the entire city smells like rotting shit, cigarette buds and dead animals, not a faint smell, an extremely strong odor that you&amp;#x27;ll eventually just become nose blind to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;homeless people, fucking everywhere, when i left my apartment there were homeless people sleeping in the hallways of my complex, when you go on walk there are homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk with a PILLOW and BLANKET while regular people walk over them like this is just some normal fucking occurrence (and in this shithole it is) never ever have i seen some shit like this even in the worst of cities ive lived in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;heroin needles, weed bags, cigarette buds &amp;amp; the occasional dildo just scattered across the city sidewalks, your constantly walking over human shit, broken bottles or dime bags&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rats and rodents EVERYWHERE. il never forget the time i bought a pizza from one of the disgusting street vendors and when i sat down at a table one of the rats were circling my feet trying to climb my leg for a bite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the &amp;quot;public transport&amp;quot; system is a just permanent housing for the mentally ill, every time i had to ride the subway i was scared for my life because of all the fucking looneys that inhabit the train systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is just off the top of my head, but i think the biggest mindfuck of it all is that its EXPENSIVE to live here its gonna cost you not 50k, not 100k, not 200k, to live comfortably by yourself you need 250K yearly in manhattan. 250k, to live among violent homeless people, 250k to constantly have to walk in rotting shit and roadkill. 250k to have your ears blown out by car horns &amp;amp; niggerbabble, 250k to be forced to smell the most putried scents imaginable i dont know why anyone sane would live here, this place is some sort of social experiment, some sort of anonmoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;Go back to your trailer park, pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872853&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872797&lt;br&gt;You know the phrase &amp;quot;If you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re not making it.

It&amp;#x27;s for the rich. Who are cut from the other, traveling with chauffered car. &lt;br&gt;The rent will drain all your earnings. &lt;br&gt;In 2020, they transformed Jew york hospitals into death camps (dyor on this). &lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a city of madness. It&amp;#x27;s the madness of our world in crisis, but concentrated. &lt;br&gt;It is a successor of Babylon, Alexandria, etc... &lt;br&gt;Stay away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877846&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DUDE i just LOVE the hustle and bustle of the big city, it’s so DYNAMIC and makes me feel like i’m in one of my favourite TV SHOWS. you should totally come on down to my studio apartment, it’s got EXPOSED RED BRICK walls and 50 square feet! we can crack open a nice hoppy ipa or three and get crazy watching some cartoons on adult swim! and dude, dude, DUDE, we have GOTTA go down to the barcade- listen here, right, it’s a BAR where us ADULTS who do ADULTING can go DRINK.

If you care about self custody, stick to routes where you keep the keys and the rules are enforced on chain. From there it’s your call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877291&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876887&lt;br&gt;OG spotted.

I’ve been contacted by a couple of friends who never talk about crypto to tell me that it’s over and I was just in a taxi when the driver told me it’s finished.

It&amp;#x27;s the reason the covid lockdowns happened. They were the only demographic at risk but they had no problem shutting society down and ruining the lives of the youth to prevent themselves from getting a bad cough. We live under boomer communism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876158&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875986&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s what my dad did, so now I get to enjoy his retirement instead. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876242&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875986&lt;br&gt;Truthnuke. The real blackpill is realizing if you&amp;#x27;re born working or middle class you will not work and save your way out towards a comfortable life until you are old, and even then, you gotta basically pray that a big unexpected money sink won&amp;#x27;t happen such as you or a close relative getting very sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your children MIGHT enjoy the fruits of your labor, and they&amp;#x27;ll do it off of your blood and sweat, and that&amp;#x27;s implying you&amp;#x27;re a high-ish IQ person who lands a good job AND invests money wisely over a time frame of 15+ years. Both conditions need to be met. But forget about &amp;quot;enjoying life&amp;quot; yourself unless you get very lucky. You don&amp;#x27;t enjoy shit when you&amp;#x27;re old. The big problem with getting hopeful about saving and investing is people thinking one day as a 50 year old is the same as one day as a 25 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875968&lt;br&gt;You should also put some extra money into that brokerage account. A million isn&amp;#x27;t what it&amp;#x27;s cracked up to be, and it&amp;#x27;ll be even less by the time you&amp;#x27;re 59 1/2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he isn&amp;#x27;t 100% in precious metals by now&lt;br&gt;NGMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876566&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876242&lt;br&gt;Life as a 50-year-old old is identical to 25 except for your have more appreciation for everything.

He doesn&amp;#x27;t have the aesthetics of a cranky, wise old man yelling about personal responsibility to foolish young whippersnappers so it doesn&amp;#x27;t work. He looks like a gay nerd because he is one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;You will be waiting forever if you expect to be saved by fixing structural issues. Act in your own best interest because no one is going to save you but you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873088&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872842&lt;br&gt;Gee I wonder if it was people or large businesses who encouraged those ills.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873031&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m not dumb enough to believe this. You fix a broken system by changing the system. Getting along within its confines is literal cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873117&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873088&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;m not dumb enough to believe this. You fix a broken system by changing the system. Getting along within its confines is literal cope.&lt;br&gt;This is nigger logic and it almost never works out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873133&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873088&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Gee I wonder if it was people or large businesses who encouraged those ills.&lt;br&gt;They were jews you retard nigger. Which is why Henry Ford literally wrote a book about them. And the Dodge Brothers sued his ass because he was looking out for his employees not shareholders. You are so fucking stupid it hurts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873139&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872704&lt;br&gt;And as a result he became public enemy #1 among leftists. They literally call him a fascist for preaching financial responsibility, lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873140&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;create media product showcasing idiocy of goyim&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;get popular &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cash in &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873914&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;Or there&amp;#x27;s an issue in the educational system that produced several generations of financial illiterates that can&amp;#x27;t say no to thrice daily starbucks, avocado toast, $3k iphones, $90k trucks, and semiannual $20k vacations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874332&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873139&lt;br&gt;The leftoids want people to be poor because poor people vote for the leftoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874447&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;The problem IS how high interest rates are. People are fucking BNPLing consumer staples and groceries, no one owns anything and are using credit cards to pay bills. Caleb is not a leftist and OP is a massive faggot for defending usury which should be banned and its purveyors should be tried for treason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876211&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873117&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This is nigger logic and it almost never works out.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the only thing that works.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873133&lt;br&gt;How&amp;#x27;s Tel Aviv?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876215&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873914&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#x27;re saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice how individuals are considered the irresponsible ones, and not the governments that devalue the currency so that it&amp;#x27;s fucking worthless? Why doesn&amp;#x27;t (((Caleb))) talk about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876223&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876222&lt;br&gt;Or the institutions that charge usury-level interest, that&amp;#x27;s another point I should add&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873088&lt;br&gt;You, as an individual, will never, ever fix the system and the chances of a revolution sweeping along to do so, which by the way will just have some other bullshit attached, is slim to none and slim just left town. That leaves you alone, in the system, to &amp;quot;cope&amp;quot;. How will you do that? By reading the rules and bending them enough to make you prosperous within its confines. Everything else is a fuckkng pipe dream and you will just waste years toiling in it when you could have been making it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats what faggots who blame the system do. They give up. They dont have the fortitude. They dont put in &amp;quot;the hard work&amp;quot; to bend the rules and make them selves prosperous. They just drag everyone else down into thier level of misery out of envy. Dont be that fucking loser. Be the guy who makes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876247&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;Despite being a fat faggot, leftists hate Caleb Hammer for making the hateful claim that you shouldn&amp;#x27;t buy junk when you have to get a 150% APY loan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876259&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;retard takes a loan with 50% interest rate to buy some burritos at chipotle and labubus&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;completely oblivious about what loan interests means&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;ITS NOT A BAD DECISION, ITS THE FAULT OF LE EVIL CAPITALISM&lt;br&gt;lmao holy fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876262&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876259&lt;br&gt;You shouldn&amp;#x27;t even be able to take out a loan at 50% kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872693&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkw21YfvpBk&amp;amp;t=927s&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally ends with &amp;quot;ahhh cool story, stand against the wall....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876302&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872750&lt;br&gt;There isn’t a structural issue. The issue is the majority of people are financially illiterate retards with no ability to delay gratification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876355&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;but really, why do the cars need to cost that much?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Because they spent 60 years demanding massive liability payouts and more &amp;amp; more regulation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile China today buys their electric car for 10k...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876361&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like the show because of the click bait guests, but there&amp;#x27;s way too many commercials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876382&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876355&lt;br&gt;Cars aren&amp;#x27;t even much more expensive if you account for inflation. &lt;br&gt;And if you consider price in gold, they are WAY cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876383&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872722&lt;br&gt;He&amp;#x27;s a homosexual so he probably is a (closeted) white supremacists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876504&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876245&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876302&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Demoralization&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;NUH UH&lt;br&gt;Spoken precisely how I&amp;#x27;d imagine someone would if they knew I was right but didn&amp;#x27;t want others to catch on.&lt;br&gt;For those interested in a fix: you get together with like-minded people and pincer from the federal and local levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the economy is rigged to make the rich richer at the expense of the poor&lt;br&gt;and&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the poor are mostly stupid goycattle who deserve to stay poor&lt;br&gt;are both true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake and Gay Economy — 47 replies — 9.3/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520?lm=1771570704</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:58:24 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Fake and Gay Economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61871520'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 47 • Updated: 2026-02-20 06:58 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When will this gay as economy finally collapse and how can i profit from it?&lt;br&gt;Its ridiculous the woman at our workplace contribute nothing to the company and make more money than i do&lt;br&gt;Its infuriating we just had a bunch of lay offs and we lost some of oir best workers but somehow a bunch of HR shits who do nothing all day still work here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HR is a necessary function, chud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871569&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871530&lt;br&gt;For what?&lt;br&gt;Genuinely why do we need it to this extent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61871755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871569&lt;br&gt;Protect the corp from lawsuits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872195&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s because they decide whom to fire.

I instantly know there is a schizo take coming when i read this. Some schizo takes are interesting, some are even good, some are good to think through and some are just funny to read. But they stzill are schizo takes and mostly bullshit influeces too much by wish bias. So how and where did this phrase pick up with schizos. When i know, its around 2021/2022 when the schizo&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;economy will collapse and people will starve due to lockdowns&lt;br&gt;did not materialize. Then they started with this phrase to somehow save their prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873806&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872076&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;no less than three seething replies about muh real capitalism&lt;br&gt;If you abolished the state it would be reinvented by the wealthy overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873944&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873611&lt;br&gt;Fake and gay was in use when I 1st started using this site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873988&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;Hopefully never because I have a fake overpaid job, just not in HR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876439&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872064&lt;br&gt;And prevent White women from breeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877263&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;everyone wants to be rich without doing jack shit, jews are just more succesful at the game and more honest about what the game is, maybe because they invented it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there are less and less people talking about &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;value&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in a real way, no one believes in it, no one believes that value is real or there is merit to providing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;everything is about winning or losing, and brother let me tell you, I&amp;#x27;m not gonna be one of the cucks who focuses on helping society or building when I can make my money sitting in my computer and playing the money game, the money game is more fun and rewarding than going to medical or engineering school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61871520&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;go in to interview for a technical role&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;see vidrel being filmed in the hallway on your way in&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the job pays well&lt;br&gt;wat do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872085&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872087&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872233&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872278&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;REAL capitalism has never been tried&lt;br&gt;This is real capitalism, and it&amp;#x27;s retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Me do asset management &amp; financial planning for a living AMAA — 53 replies — 9.1/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872433</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872433?lm=1771567846</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:10:46 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Me do asset management &amp;amp; financial planning for a living AMAA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61872433'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 53 • Updated: 2026-02-20 06:10 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me do asset management &amp;amp; financial planning for a living AMAA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872440&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Looks boring af.

I’m thinking of a split between SPYI, QQQI, O, and SCHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latest replies (last 30, oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61872998&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872888&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of assets that meet or beat equity markets with CAGR and are low correlation. Some are right in the data here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872698&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gold for example has a higher average annual return, better risk adjusted return, and a 0.1 correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;All on btc shorts. Outperform those gay indexes for the next three years in one week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873080&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872467&lt;br&gt;Why do you focus on yield so much instead of total returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a lot of US large cap equity exposure with tax inefficiency if it&amp;#x27;s in a taxable account. You&amp;#x27;ll get big dividend though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like PTY, ASGI, etc for yield personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873145&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872998&lt;br&gt;no it fucking doesn&amp;#x27;t, in the last 110 years it has returned 5% while the stock market returned 10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873145&lt;br&gt;ik this is probably bait but that&amp;#x27;s a very silly time period to look at because before we got off the gold standard it was fixed ounces/USD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaning 0% growth for half that period dragging the CAGR way down lol. Doesn&amp;#x27;t make sense to look at the return pre Nixon shock for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;if you like uncorrelated risk adjusted-returns you should look at alternative investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;Returns are totally dependent on the managers imho, it&amp;#x27;s a cool class. I&amp;#x27;m not a huge fan of the illiquidity personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do like some of them them, especially private farmland/timberland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not a huge fan of venture or growth PE, guess I&amp;#x27;m lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873214&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873207&lt;br&gt;have you looked into managed futures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873220&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873080&lt;br&gt;I use my brokerage as my main savings account. Instead of getting $500/month in a high yield savings account I rather get $1400, 50-75% I could reinvest. But since you do this for a living I&amp;#x27;m going to listen and allocate more money for growth rather than yield going forward, and you&amp;#x27;re right about the taxes, I didn&amp;#x27;t think too much about that. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873222&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873214&lt;br&gt;I cant believe I forgot about those!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I use the ETFs for simplicity. ISMF/CTA for crisis alpha. I almost went DBMF too, but I prefer the purer systematic trend heavy ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you have any strong opinions on them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like extreme negative correlation, like -0.4 with 6-8% CAGR which is completely acceptable if you&amp;#x27;re rebalancing with a really aggressive equity portfolio. I considered pairing them with TQQQ or SOXL to be a total jackass at once point and pussed out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873231&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873220&lt;br&gt;You accept more risk (volatility) for those higher returns, that&amp;#x27;s the tradeoff. If you are OK with higher risk then you could always choose one of those balanced allocation funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOR for example just rebalances a 60% stock / 40% bond index portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AOA does the same thing but 80% stock (more risk)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These really are the easy button for people that don&amp;#x27;t want to self-manage imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably a good idea to put the portion that&amp;#x27;s your emergency fund into something boring and very lowvol but decent yield. Check out JPST, that might be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873256&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873222&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873190&lt;br&gt;those are the returns for my managed futures program, im a CTA. its great uncorrelated returns but theres a lot of programs that under perform or blow up (-60%+ years). its definitely more liquid than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873270&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873256&lt;br&gt;Damn dude you&amp;#x27;re crushing it. What&amp;#x27;s the time period on those returns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind if I ask what your strategy is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any specific managed futures ETFs you like? Are they even close to replicating the actuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873270&lt;br&gt;thats 20 months of performance trading 8 different futures markets. semi-systematic medium frequency trend following. im not too familiar with the ETFs that track managed futures but they usually focus on the billion dollar CTAs and those programs are lower returns lower risk just trying to be uncorrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873448&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873184&lt;br&gt;ok, its still not beating the stock market unlike your claim, and if you take the last 3 years out and it drops a lot. That is insane volatility that it doesn&amp;#x27;t converge after 50 years. Realistically the actual return is maybe 7% and you get very long periods of dogshit ~3%, and for all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m currently halfway through finishing my CFP course&lt;br&gt;Any advice for someone trying to hit the ground running, beyond spamming LinkedIn? Or should I just accept that this job market is going to rape me until I give up hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873477&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Cant ai just do most of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873686&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;This. Almost tooka financial advisor job. Then I realized, &amp;quot;why the fuck would anybody talk to a human about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Cause the AI will tell you something plausible that it thinks you want to hear, and it will partially or mostly hallucinate the data it uses to deliver that response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61873887&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Do you hold any bitcoin? What are your thoughts on it and does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874040&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872561&lt;br&gt;I am a europoor(in a very poor country) so I dont think i have access to most the stuff you are listing. I can only buy ETFs, I have most my portfolio in a Global market cap ETF some in europe ETF and a little in small cap value international and emerging markets. Also bought a sizable stack of silver sub 30 dollars but its going to be a bitch to sell. I dont invest in bonds since I think that every government will just keep on printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874046&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873450&lt;br&gt;Connections are everything, and the exam will be easier than you think. The classes were hugely valuable, were harder and more useful than my master&amp;#x27;s degree courses. Most companies will have you try to peddle shit insurance products to friends/family at the entry level it&amp;#x27;s gross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873477&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873686&lt;br&gt;Maybe someday, not right now. For what &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873827 said and because it just sucks at answering niche or complex questions. When I ask it things it usually feeds me flat out wrong answers that would be passable to someone that didn&amp;#x27;t do any research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example is having it try to pick stocks. Gets obliterated by the index funds every time. It&amp;#x27;s a consistent loser at this because it can&amp;#x27;t make forward projections and the question is too complicated for it. Tax questions are a horror show too, you&amp;#x27;d think it would be good at those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main issue with AI in my eyes is that it just doesn&amp;#x27;t understand humans/human nature. Most of my job is behavioral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;I do, I made a bunch of money in it 2016ish and now build and rebalance a position in my retirement accounts (5-10% allocation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874061&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874040&lt;br&gt;Wish I knew more about EU investing, I&amp;#x27;m completely specialized for US investing so it&amp;#x27;s out of my wheelhouse. I only have a handful of expat/foreign clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EU bonds have been zero or even negative for a long time. I won&amp;#x27;t touch them because they don&amp;#x27;t compensate you for loaning them money, and I can&amp;#x27;t believe people keep buying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently it has something to do with their SIPC insurance equivalent, safer park for cash than a checking account basically because of the federal coverage you get by buying a bond. I haven&amp;#x27;t looked much into it just what I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873887&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;does your firm/company advise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgot to answer this part. We don&amp;#x27;t buy it in our portfolios, but we do help clients manage the risk associated with it. Some people are believers in crypto so we highlight the risks (volatility, no intrinsic value, etc) and then work with them to figure out how much of their overall investments is a prudent amount to put into that risk asset. I personally cap myself at 10% for both gold and crypto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crypto is actually considered speculation instead of investing by most managers. Kind of like commodities/gold/NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874261&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61873448&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;its still not beating the stock market &lt;br&gt;It does in the 26-year backward looking period in the data array from the picture by 30bp. Instead of just pulling 7% out of your booty you could spend 10 seconds doing the present value calculation if you really wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s about 9.8% annualized if you go all the way back to &amp;#x27;71 from now ($39-$5,000). That&amp;#x27;s definitely nothing to scoff at when constructing a portfolio and hedging equity markets considering the 0.1 correlation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;That is insane volatility&lt;br&gt;Volatility is good in a portfolio of non-correlated assets that&amp;#x27;s rebalanced outside of tolerance bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;all that volatility it still doesn&amp;#x27;t match the market&lt;br&gt;Almost keeps up with it and doesn&amp;#x27;t move in the same direction, which is the idea. Non-correlated assets, rebalancing the volatility, and risk-return tradeoff are portfolio construction 101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874286&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright anon, I&amp;#x27;m out. Have a great day and I hope every one of you gets to retire early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS long nursing homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874295&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61872433&lt;br&gt;Is there a gap in the asset management &amp;amp; financial planning software market? Seems you are just using an excel sheet there. Is there any way your life could be easier or more automated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a developer and I like money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61874345&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874295&lt;br&gt;The software is pretty comprehensive and generally way deeper than just an excel sheet, but of course there&amp;#x27;s an industry spectrum of how deep/detailed the analysis goes by firm and by program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some is straight up basically a cash flows projection laid on top of a balance sheet (excel). The people that use this are shitty whole life insurance people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the auxiliary software where the money is at right now it seems. AI that reads trusts using OCR and spits out a summary to help you find issues. Tax software. Stuff like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our software for portfolio management (have used 3) is AWFUL though. That&amp;#x27;s a big gap for asset management imho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876336&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61874261&lt;br&gt;Im sorry but your sample size is not big enough. The volatility and nature of the distribution of gold prices (its not normally distributed) means you have to be very careful about inferring information about long term returns. For example if you look at gold as an asset just 5 years ago you get very different conclusions. &lt;br&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo If the data changes heavily based on the precise dates or periods that you choose it indicates it hasn&amp;#x27;t converged to an acceptable error margin yet. 7% is a guess at what an average random sample period would be given that they can range from ~3% to ~9% or w/e but idk, im not gonna do your job for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simple sanity check should tell you that an asset that doesn&amp;#x27;t produce or do much of anything shouldn&amp;#x27;t outperform real cash generating businesses and companies in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877215&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you Jewish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Finding a job — 21 replies — 7.4/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875447</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875447?lm=1771578564</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 09:09:24 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Finding a job&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61875447'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 21 • Updated: 2026-02-20 09:09 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live near Tampa FL and I&amp;#x27;m wondering what are some viable strategies for actually finding work instead of applying to 1000 ghost job listings and praying someone calls me back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early replies (first 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61875498&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875447&lt;br&gt;Head to your nearest mcdonalds and talk to the manager.

Then when you find a role you like start asking questions about the role (even if you already know the answer) with the goal of getting them to put you in direct touch with the hiring manager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m in engineering (real engineering not SWE) so I ask them about NCEES licensure, inter-state reciprocity of license to practice engineering, or some technical questions for the role that HR would never be able to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875447&lt;br&gt;walk into a dealership. dont look like a weak faggot. profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876060&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875971&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m just asking about a wage job bro I don&amp;#x27;t have any qualifications for a engineering job or whatever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876065&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876007&lt;br&gt;For a sales job? Do a lot of them have base pay? I hate commission based sales jobs. Gayest fucking shit ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876138&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876060&lt;br&gt;Oh then refer to &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875498&lt;br&gt;Menial labor is hiring in droves.&lt;br&gt;Just do the wagie song and dance.&lt;br&gt;Ghost jobs are almist exclusive to salaried roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61876141&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876065&lt;br&gt;dont sell dont get paid. you are worth what you are. no cap on your income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877127&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875498&lt;br&gt;Assuming OP is white, why would that plan even work? Imagine being a manager and hiring a guy who most likely jump ship in a few months or even less the moment he gets a better job? You need people who have no literal choice but to work there for years for minimum wage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877136&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you Indian? If not, sorry, no job for you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877248&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61875447&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think they have anything in Tampa but keep ULINE in mind if it comes down to getting anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877348&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876141&lt;br&gt;Nah fuck that gay retard frat bro shit. That kind of business model is usually like Mary Kay for dudes. Most of those guys are miserable sacks of shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877372&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876141&lt;br&gt;no cap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61877582&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61876060&lt;br&gt;I got my first wagie job when I was 15 by just walking around the shopping district asking stores for job applications. Got offered a dishwasher role at a Friday&amp;#x27;s or something but took the job at Taco Bell instead since it was closer to my house and I had to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>&gt;LINK has done a 1.06x in 6 years What the fuck? — 6 replies — 5.9/hr</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61877076</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61877076?lm=1771585144</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:59:04 +0000</pubDate><description>Open</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&amp;gt;LINK has done a 1.06x in 6 years What the fuck?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61877076'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 6 • Updated: 2026-02-20 10:59 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;LINK has done a 1.06x in 6 years&lt;br&gt;What the fuck?
