There is actually less, not more, demand for silver now that speculators jumped ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854087&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine waiting a decade or more for the big pump (3x), it finally arrives and you somehow fuck it up and fail to profit.&lt;br&gt;Almost feel bad for silvercucks but someone has to lose the game if others are going to accumulate wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854101&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852958&lt;br&gt;The system is severely overleveraged and the coming crash will make 2008 look like child’s play. Just sell some every time there’s a 10% pump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854143&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853190&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;A billionaire just got banned from trading on the Shanghai exchange for shorting silver in excess of the entire exchange value.&lt;br&gt;lmao, really? that&amp;#x27;s great. financialization is a hell of a drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854153&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854101&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;overleveraged&lt;br&gt;that&amp;#x27;s my safe word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854167&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no demand when its digital and not physical fuck you on about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854174&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853210&lt;br&gt;this is called moving the goal posts (or maybe just changing the subject? lmao) after you were proven wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853903&lt;br&gt;Was agreeing with you till you said good is hyper-inflated. That literally goes against all fundamentals. Have you even looked at an inflation adjusted chart? It’s got near identical buying power as it did 100 years ago….&lt;br&gt;Money is pegged to the worth of gold, not the other way around.&lt;br&gt;Kinda makes me think you don’t actually know what you’re talking about lmao.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also what are these assets you claim don’t go down and hold value? Is it weapons? Do you own a freshwater lake? Like what? You realise the whole market is red right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854190&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853221&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Silver is the 3rd largest asset cap in the world&lt;br&gt;retarded, it&amp;#x27;s not. That&amp;#x27;s using all mined silver ever. Look at the amount available:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;98.1 million ounces comex registered&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;300 million ounces comex eligible&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;891 million troy ounces lbma (if you believe them)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;26 million ounces Shanghai&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;?? dubai, lets say 50 million&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;total: 1.37 billion&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;market cap@80: 110billion&lt;br&gt;Note, LBMA is pretty much OTC and eligible isn&amp;#x27;t supposed to be traded. The book for silver&amp;#x27;s exchange market is really thin and it&amp;#x27;s breaking. Price is probably going to gravitate to 180-225 in the near term, but it&amp;#x27;s going to be really bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854197&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852958&lt;br&gt;holo cute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854207&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852958&lt;br&gt;It may be high but not high enough for shops to buy from you. So you cuck out and lower the price out of FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854236&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853183&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;fictional goblin&lt;br&gt;A very real goblin &lt;br&gt;gobblin&amp;#x27; up those profits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854274&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853183&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Do you really believe that there is a group of people that is so incredibly powerful and coordinated that they can control all global markets for a physically wide-held asset simultaneously?&lt;br&gt;uuuh... yes? Isn&amp;#x27;t it obvious by now? Are you 18yo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854304&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852963&lt;br&gt;You ever seen this before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854274&lt;br&gt;Why do you believe Jews are superior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854327&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854036&lt;br&gt;Sell off slowly over the decades. Leave some for your family to inherit when you die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854304&lt;br&gt;no that&amp;#x27;s a good one kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854338&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854087&lt;br&gt;I sold a bar 2 days ago before the drop. Nearly a triple profit off that. I don&amp;#x27;t care if it spikes or crashes now. The rest of my silver is for future funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854559&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I NEED silver to drop back to pre-2025 prices. I didn’t take it seriously and failed to accumulate a meaningful stack (around 80oz AG 0.7oz AU) and I wish to rectify my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854576&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two wolfs inside the stacker &lt;br&gt;One wolf wants spot to moon, to sell for the big profits&lt;br&gt;One wolf wants it to crash, for the cheapies to scoop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854592&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854304&lt;br&gt;In the original book, Frank Baum called them the silver slippers. Not the ruby slippers. Add in the yellow brick road, and the symbology of &amp;quot;Oz&amp;quot; (ounces) becomes very obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854613&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854592&lt;br&gt;wow that makes a lot of sense&lt;br&gt;and yeah &amp;quot;ruby slippers&amp;quot; is retarded when you think about it. nobody puts gem stones on slippers kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854628&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854592&lt;br&gt;What about the fields of poppies?&lt;br&gt;Wasn&amp;#x27;t that supposed to mean something as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854636&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fundamentals win in the end but if you&amp;#x27;re levered up you&amp;#x27;re insane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854661&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854628&lt;br&gt;Not sure, but I know that the opium trade started in China because they demanded payment in silver from the UK for their tea. However the UK didn&amp;#x27;t have enough silver so they spread opium among the people to get them addicted and paid with that instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854814&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853183&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You people are delusional. Gold holders winning again as per usual&lt;br&gt;I never knew why the SETF fucktards did not simply convert to physical gold. I never understood their demented, twisted ways. And I still don&amp;#x27;t. And no, they never coverted their stashes to gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854889&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854814&lt;br&gt;you gold bugs don&amp;#x27;t seem to understand simple math&lt;br&gt;look at the GSR graph&lt;br&gt;silver is winning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855828&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854184&lt;br&gt;It doesn&amp;#x27;t go against all fundamentals to realize that an asset with a long history of stable growth suddenly going parabolic is likely to crash back to the stable rate. Gold isn&amp;#x27;t gonna crash to 0 but it wouldn&amp;#x27;t shock me at all if it went down to 3k for the next few years.&lt;br&gt;Also, the magical asset that holds value and doesn&amp;#x27;t go down is a highly diversified portfolio + some stock gambling with the money you can afford to lose. Also property. Most of my gains this year are from gold but i think it&amp;#x27;s foolish to not recognize that the fun will be over soon and if it is it&amp;#x27;s market action, not conspiracy. The price of gold is currently extremely high because everything is so uncertain with the US government being insanely unpredictable but that won&amp;#x27;t last forever. The domino is gonna fall one direction or the other.&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#x27;s no way to get rich quick (unless you&amp;#x27;re launching a business and get mega lucky)... but there are plenty of ways to get decently wealthy slowly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854043&lt;br&gt;Why would I make sockpuppets to agree with me on a cantonese gambling website&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854889&lt;br&gt;Whatever helps you sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855975&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852958&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Silver demand at all-time high&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Silver supply at all-time low&lt;br&gt;cose its fake news&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771052525969244s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>/XMR/ Monero General — 249 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61810651</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61810651?lm=1771178543</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 18:02:23 +0000</pubDate><description>Open article for full thread</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;/XMR/ Monero General&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61810651'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 249 • Updated: 2026-02-15 18:02 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world&amp;#x27;s most widely adopted privacy coin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR payments are anonymous, low-fee, and fully fungible. Users can send and receive XMR globally without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain; the TX history of all XMR users is kept hidden, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic block size that can &amp;quot;stretch&amp;quot; to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR&amp;#x27;s mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR&amp;#x27;s tail emission - 0.6 XMR per block forever - incentivizes for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation trends to zero and is offset by coin loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR has proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC&amp;#x27;s network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. XMR is also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you still have questions, feel free to ask. A MoneroChad will be with you shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR Redpill: https://youtube.com/watch?v=wq6w03E2DS4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUY XMR: https://monero.eco/exchanges/&lt;br&gt;Crypto ATMs: https://coinatmradar.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR Resources: https://monero.observer/resources/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XMR Stats: https://moneroj.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;USE XMR: https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xmr/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OFFICIAL WEBSITE: https://getmonero.org&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MINING: &lt;br&gt;https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/mining/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WALLETS:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Desktop&lt;br&gt;Official GUI/CLI wallet&lt;br&gt;Featherwallet&lt;br&gt;Stack Wallet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Mobile&lt;br&gt;Cake Wallet&lt;br&gt;Monero.com&lt;br&gt;Stack Wallet&lt;br&gt;Unstoppable &lt;br&gt;Monerujo (Android)&lt;br&gt;Monfluo (Android)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Infodumps&lt;br&gt;https://rentry.org/monero-explained&lt;br&gt;https://moneroinfodump.neocities.org &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61761870&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Replies (oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61848827&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should look for ways to improve Monero&amp;#x27;s (official) material and appearance, not to induce any kind of pump, but to effectively convey the principles and message of why Monero, specifically out of other privacy coins, is extremely unique in the freedom it provides in contrast to all other money systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now it seems like very old material, links and screencaps keeps getting recycled. There&amp;#x27;s so many recent world events happening that tie in to Monero&amp;#x27;s use and we&amp;#x27;re missing a translation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monerochan (mostly AI slop) also doesn&amp;#x27;t communicate anything about Monero&lt;br&gt;There doesn&amp;#x27;t seem to be any good image macros to share from these threads&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interested in how other people view this issue and what kind of material would get the communication standard up to the same level as its founding principles and tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849019&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848053&lt;br&gt;Thanks anon.

Monerocucks are glowniggers, pretending to not be. Its funny watching them recoil in fear though. Just look at the past few generals, they cant even BTFO nerva jeets lmfao... look here&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61831334&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847825&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;why cant they just tell reddit why its safe?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;doesnt and cant&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;cant even tell 4channers in a simple format&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Well *I* asked *you* that one for a reason.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Please tell me what explicit attack scenario exists in which the five dollar wrench and current KYC measurements are infeasible but having to give out your view keys is.&lt;br&gt;the taxman who says &amp;quot;gib?&amp;quot; Normies fold faster than a wet noodle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848809&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You were already given the a TLDR&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;At what point will you accept this answer?&lt;br&gt;cant even get a copy and paste job on here&lt;br&gt;oh...&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;1pbtid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You all sound like pathetic freemasons who suck jew dick.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;wErE nOt BaD pPl!? oH bUt YoU hAvE tO jOiN uS tO fInD OuT wHaT wE BeLiEvE iN!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;kills you when you defect or tell a secret after finding out they worship the satan&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;lmao moneroniggers and their copium at their finest. Go glow on some other basket weaving forum. Is it any wonder XMR generals never get banned for advertisement? Its because 4chan is backdoored with JDIF, and JDIF &amp;amp; Monero suck each others dicks. One big blowjob circlejerk for their father satan.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;inb4 some cuck even tries to reply to me, you cant even keep up with my precision and speed. anyone who reads this knows im right. i use your shill threads to spread truth, and there is nothing you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849859&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848827&lt;br&gt;I feel like most of the older stuff is still applicable since it&amp;#x27;s just about the basics. See picrel as an example. However I agree that the more specific guides (for example how and where to get XMR) rarely has good pictures. Do you have other bad examples so we can make a list? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;cant even tell 4channers in a simple format&lt;br&gt;Five sentences isn&amp;#x27;t hard if you ask me. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the taxman who says &amp;quot;gib?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;1. You already need to be deanonymized for that. The ways you can get deanonymized will stay the same. This would also be combated by using an exchange wallet. I&amp;#x27;d probably even use an on-ramp wallet, an off-ramp wallet and a holding wallet. This way even if you were deanonymized and the IRS asks for more than what they&amp;#x27;re allowed to ask (just the income as a number, not the sources or which bank account it went to) you&amp;#x27;d still retain your privacy. &lt;br&gt;2. This is already possible by being coerced through various means. A view key won&amp;#x27;t change that. This is proven by your next sentence. &amp;gt;Normies fold faster than a wet noodle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short: All proposed &amp;#x27;new&amp;#x27; attack vectors already exist, require additional information that isn&amp;#x27;t easily obtained (they tried for years and still couldn&amp;#x27;t get it) and are easily mitigated. &lt;br&gt;Additionally, if someone for whatever reason was willing to inform the IRS of the relevant taxes by directly allowing access to view the wallet (which still is absurd and not how it works) it&amp;#x27;d be much easier and also less risky. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have any other scenarios in which view keys could be exploited which are not covered already please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850085&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re clearly retarded and can&amp;#x27;t follow a conversation, so I&amp;#x27;ll highlight the points for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I gave the answer to the view key FUD here&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61838278&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which sent anon into a tizzy that didn&amp;#x27;t actually refute anything I posted, here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61838817&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;whos doomer porn fantasy? XMRfags cant even keep an eye on whos talking to who in here. I dont care about nerva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which I then edited to ease his butthurt here&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61839127&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The TLDR is that this particular doomer porn fantasy can&amp;#x27;t compromise anyone&amp;#x27;s privacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he wanted an official statement from the devs to ease his butthurt &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847581&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I gave him that too &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847618&lt;br&gt;Which sent anon into another tizzy, because he seems to agree with some redditor that &amp;quot;it&amp;#x27;s just toooooo hard to read the documentation! Why can&amp;#x27;t they spoonfeed me!?&amp;quot; Here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61847794&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;why should i trust monero at all&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;picrelated from reddit thread. why cant they just tell reddit why its safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To which I then pounted out that he was already given the spoonfed answer that doesn&amp;#x27;t require him to read anything on github or librera &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848809&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then asked the same question I&amp;#x27;ll ask you now:&lt;br&gt;At what point will you accept this answer? Seriously, what don&amp;#x27;t you faggots get?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850591&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848021&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been waiting for a few hours now. Due to your lack of questions I assume you are agreeing with me that carrot does not pose a privacy threat. I&amp;#x27;m glad we could finally come to an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851129&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849859&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850085&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850591&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been waiting for a few hours now. Due to your lack of questions I assume you are agreeing with me that carrot does not pose a privacy threat&lt;br&gt;There is a good chance he&amp;#x27;s banned. For some reason, criticizing your shitcoin (Monero) is against jannie law. I was banned recently for criticizing it. Look at the nerva faggots. They keep being banned as well. What doesnt puzzle anyone is how your general stays up for days without deletion, yet the only organic traction your threads have are from posters who get banned criticizing you. Its because youre a bunch of glowniggers who work for (((the island bunch))) and have this site backdoored. If competition shows up, the thread gets shadow banned and falls off the catalog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Youll never answer the questions regarding the upcoming fork and always link their github page because YOU dont understand it. Face the truth, the reason the reddit comments dont get answered is because NO ONE understands it. The reason the even more damning questions get deleted is because theyre asking the right questions. For some reason, Monero thinks its better to implement something that is unnecessary rather than something that should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;In short: All proposed &amp;#x27;new&amp;#x27; attack vectors already exist&lt;br&gt;Take a good hard look at that statement youre defending&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Which sent anon into a tizzy that didn&amp;#x27;t actually refute anything I posted&lt;br&gt;Maybe its because you all brought up the &amp;quot;doomer fantasy&amp;quot;? He never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your wins are not the wins you think they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;At what point will you accept this answer? Seriously, what don&amp;#x27;t you faggots get?&lt;br&gt;Since youll never post an answer to the questions, Why should they repeat themselves? Its an XMR thread, not the audience&amp;#x27;s thread. You have to provide an adequate answer and are up for scrutiny, not them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851235&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;For some reason, criticizing your shitcoin (Monero) is against jannie law.&lt;br&gt;No, you retards get banned for shilling for nerva. Also it&amp;#x27;s weird to assume he got banned after his 14th post over 3 days meanwhile you&amp;#x27;ve also posted fud over the days and still are present. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They keep being banned as well.&lt;br&gt;Who knows, maybe it&amp;#x27;s the constant shilling and the spam they don&amp;#x27;t just post here but on the board itself through a variety of threads. Btw when you don&amp;#x27;t get banned your generals just hit page 10 and die. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;What doesnt puzzle anyone is how your general stays up for days without deletion,&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s because the XMR general is fairly active and removing established generals would just lead to more shitposting. I hope you don&amp;#x27;t want the 10 millionth LINK thread this year.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;yet the only organic traction your threads have are from posters who get banned criticizing you.&lt;br&gt;Did you forget the moonfags that tried to take over this general, the qubic fud, the view key fud and the zioncash shills? All of those happened less than 6 months ago. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and have this site backdoored.&lt;br&gt;No need for a backdoor when the mods are jews and feds. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;If competition shows up, the thread gets shadow banned and falls off the catalog.&lt;br&gt;Really? What happened to &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61841738 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61827591 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61822264 and &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61809799? Those are just some of the ones you had and that died because your community consists entirely of a few jeets and baggies. Graciously I sometimes enter your threads and ask you simple questions which you can&amp;#x27;t answer despite their simplicity. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youll never answer the questions regarding the upcoming fork&lt;br&gt;I did a few hours ago and now I&amp;#x27;m waiting for more questions. Let me know if you have some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851245&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;always link their github page because&lt;br&gt;Me? No I didn&amp;#x27;t. I know github is something that challenges the nerva jeet heavily so instead I break it down in very simple terms. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;because YOU dont understand it.&lt;br&gt;Your questions? You don&amp;#x27;t seem to have any.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the reason the reddit comments dont get answered is because NO ONE understands it.&lt;br&gt;I already answered all of the questions I saw. If you have more let me know. The assumption that no one understand cryptography or psychology is absurd considering the existence of that field. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;The reason the even more damning questions get deleted is because theyre asking the right questions.&lt;br&gt;Like what? So far each question I saw I answered on here. I don&amp;#x27;t use reddit but feel free to keep me updated on orange site. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;For some reason, Monero thinks its better to implement something that is unnecessary&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;ve already been told that view keys will have some benefits. I recall hardware wallet and merchant software support being named in this thread. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;rather than something that should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;Devs, due to being part of a community and mostly unpaid, decide what they wish to implement. If it&amp;#x27;s fcmp++ they&amp;#x27;ll work on fcmp++, if it&amp;#x27;s carrot, they&amp;#x27;ll work on carrot. You can&amp;#x27;t force strangers that donate their time to do only what you want them to do especially if it&amp;#x27;s a feature you can easily avoid. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Take a good hard look at that statement youre defending&lt;br&gt;That literally nothing will worsen with carrot? Seems like a fine statement to me. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Since youll never post an answer to the questions,&lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t speak for anon but I already answered every question you have. If you have any other questions let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851255&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;In return I&amp;#x27;d like to ask you a few questions: &lt;br&gt;1. How do you ensure unmaintained software keeps up with the security demands it has?&lt;br&gt;2. How do you ensure that no one attacks nerva by locally clustering CPUs? &lt;br&gt;3. Why do your devs believe Discord to be a development platform despite being on github? &lt;br&gt;4. How do you ensure the safety of your devs in case of an attack by glowies if they all use the ID-requiring discord and 40% of them (50% of your lead devs) having doxxed themselves publicly?&lt;br&gt;5. What other questions do you have for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851332&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851235&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;No, you retards get banned for shilling for nerva. Also it&amp;#x27;s weird to assume he got banned after his 14th post over 3 days meanwhile you&amp;#x27;ve also posted fud over the days and still are present. &lt;br&gt;Ive posted twice you jeetbot, (3 times now) and none of it was about nerva. Ill disregard the rest of this botpost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851245&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Your questions? You don&amp;#x27;t seem to have any.&lt;br&gt;Never did, go back and reread my posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851255&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;xmrbotpost about nerva. &lt;br&gt;Never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Glownero&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851379&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851332&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Ive posted twice&lt;br&gt;Correct, I was speaking about rVCB8pdb, I assume you were doing that too or do you speak about yourself in the third person? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;and none of it was about nerva.&lt;br&gt;Good job not having and reading comprehension and forgetting you posted: &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;they cant even BTFO nerva jeets lmfao (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849231)&lt;br&gt;and: &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I was banned recently for criticizing it. Look at the nerva faggots. (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851332&lt;br&gt;You combined any criticism against XMR with nerva. So by your own logic most of the criticism here comes from the nervajeets.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Never did,&lt;br&gt;If you don&amp;#x27;t have any questions, then why do you keep pestering me about needing to answer them? &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;All three of your posts mentioned nerva in a positive light.&lt;br&gt;Feel free to answer any of my questions (see &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851255 for the easiest ones) or give me any of the question which you apparently don&amp;#x27;t have but are lamenting as being unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851533&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851129&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Youll never answer the questions regarding the upcoming fork and always link their github page because YOU dont understand it.&lt;br&gt;I link the github because I like having a source to back up my claims, and I actually want you to stop being a faggot and refute them&lt;br&gt;No, accusations of being a fedfreemasonbot out to get you are not refutations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;For some reason, Monero thinks its better to implement something that is unnecessary rather than something that should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;Who exactly are you to decide whether or not a feature is unnecessary and shouldn&amp;#x27;t be implemented?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Maybe its because you all brought up the &amp;quot;doomer fantasy&amp;quot;? He never mentioned it.&lt;br&gt;Given how he was asking about them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61838139&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;so when someone says kyc will ask for this and then the feds will use it for surveillance, theyre correct? then it&amp;#x27;s not FUD&lt;br&gt;I hit the fast forward button on his line of thought since he clearly believes that view keys present some sort of threat, and I didn&amp;#x27;t feel like waiting 10 posts for him to go &amp;quot;WELL IF THEY GET ENOUGH TO VIEW KEYS IT&amp;#x27;LL BE THE END OF PRIVACY!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;If this was wrong of me, then my bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Your wins are not the wins you think they are.&lt;br&gt;Who said I was trying to win anything? Why are you perpetuating this weird fantasy? You&amp;#x27;re weird bro. Not a good look at all, man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851879&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been out of it for a while, how do I buy some and use it to acquire ketamine? Last time I was doing this, we used bitcoin and it was $220.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852742&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851879&lt;br&gt;Send any major crypto to Trocador. Swap to XMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852911&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851879&lt;br&gt;What this guy said&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852742&lt;br&gt;Then visit Dread dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad onion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853405&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851879&lt;br&gt;Get any other coin and swap for Monero on Trocador.&lt;br&gt;Have the monero sent to your cake wallet.&lt;br&gt;Go on Dread to find what&amp;#x27;s the current best darknet market.&lt;br&gt;Go on the DNM and buy your product with Monero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the steps take a bit of time but it&amp;#x27;s not complicated. Once you know how everything works it&amp;#x27;s no more complex than an Amazon order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854237&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61810651&lt;br&gt;Bloomberg published an article on Monero this morning. It’s behind a paywall but here is the article thanks to some Twitter anon.&lt;br&gt;https://pastebin.com/6aqniwe1&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;As digital assets go mainstream and law enforcement agencies get more adept at seizing illicit crypto, “privacy coins” like Monero hark back to the industry’s foundational idea: the creation of a decentralized electronic cash system running outside the purview of governments and central banks. That’s given them a cult following among libertarian-leaning crypto users — while providing a handy tool for criminals.&lt;br&gt;The rest of the article is just (((Bloomberg))) seething about how it can’t be tracked and a mention of the upcoming hard fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854655&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854237&lt;br&gt;They really seemed to think the view key fud would be more effective if they now need to publish paid articles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855033&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61696670&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;suggest wallet that can store XRP,XMR,USDT and Zcash is there any&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out this actually does exist. Hope this anon is still lurking &lt;br&gt;https://edge.app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855123&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I need to send someone 5$ for a beer while anonymous. Thing is I have no fucking clue how any of this cryptocurrency works. Can someone explain to me same way you would to a retard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855365&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855123&lt;br&gt;Yeah, follow the chat here: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61817263&lt;br&gt;If you have any issue or problem at a specific step ask here and we&amp;#x27;ll help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy the &amp;quot;beer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855558&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855365&lt;br&gt;Ok, installed the cake wallet program, made the wallet, both monero and litecoin. Now I need to actually buy the crypto so I can transfer it to the wallet I just made. I think I still have an old paypal account which apparently allows you to buy crypto now. Is that ok for me to buy litecoin, transfer it to the cake wallet and exchange it for monero or will I be de-anonymized for using paypal just this once?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855558&lt;br&gt;Once it gets to your wallet it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855579&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855558&lt;br&gt;I never bought crypto with PayPal but if you can buy LTC, do it. Once you swap to Monero and have it in your personal wallet you become invisible and cannot be deanonymized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856711&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854237&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854655&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Jewish media bashing monero&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Just like they did with Trump&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Sub Artic IQs dont notice theyre promoting it on purpose&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Paid promoters ITT walk around the fact that concern was brought up by actual users and went unanswered or were outright removed posts/threads, then claim the view key fud was started by the very mossad theyre unironically supporting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Glowner, promoted by Glews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856863&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856711&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Monero General&amp;quot; thread&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;CTRL + F &amp;quot;nerva&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;140 results&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your unmaintained shitcoin will NEVER be relevant you poojeet retards. Everyone with more than 2 braincells can tell that you&amp;#x27;ve been shitting up the board trying to advertise. Please do the needful and make your own general. Except you can&amp;#x27;t do that right?

Some riddle of a hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857169&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guys, schizo chicken lady here, recovering from a week of waging after my xrp stack never mooned. Honestly I think we&amp;#x27;re deluded thinking xrp is going to moon at all. There are only 1000 active accounts and 50k daily transactions on the xrp ledger. I think any price pumps were due to ripple marketing. Sorry. I sold 25% of my xrp this week for Tron. There&amp;#x27;s zero hype about Tron in news or gematria. In fact i can&amp;#x27;t find any secondary information about it. But it has 850m daily transactions and has outperformed xrp since inception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857211&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meme is that xrp will moon when it finds utility. But the ledger has been around for 14 years and no one is using it, mo natter how many riddles, acquisitions, or tweets ripple spits out. The ledger just seems like an clunky ibm project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857230&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857211&lt;br&gt;Then why is it that every time we break out and start to climb they dump the whole market to suppress us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857238&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857230&lt;br&gt;The chart the last six months just looks like a steady decline, not a surpresssed breakout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857247&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857169&lt;br&gt;CHICKEN TRANNY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857238&lt;br&gt;Yeah except last night we were chartmogging BTC by pumpmaxing to 1.66 out of nowhere and the Epstein client list got mad and pissed their pants and dumped the market to bring us back into line by dragging us down with them. How many times you been to the island chicken schizo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857374&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857211&lt;br&gt;Look to the access that Brad Garlinghouse has to the White House and crypto councils formed by the President.&lt;br&gt;Most of the other people in that sphere, are from crypto exchanges.&lt;br&gt;Brad, along with the CEO&amp;#x27;s of Solano, Chainlink, and a few others are in that sphere.&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a position of great influence and power.&lt;br&gt;There is no reason for Brad not to use his influence with politicians to push for institutional adoption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EverNorth is going to go public on the Nasdaq some time this 1st quarter of 2026.&lt;br&gt;They&amp;#x27;ve said that they are going to use the same approach as the company Micro Strategy does for Bitcoin; but with XRP.&lt;br&gt;This is a huge amount of buying of XRP that will start occurring once they go public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of that being said, I don&amp;#x27;t blame you for diversifying.&lt;br&gt;I know nothing of Tron, but if you feel it&amp;#x27;s a better performing investment, then best of luck to you.&lt;br&gt;And you still have 3/4 of your XRP bag too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857491&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857112&lt;br&gt;I all I can say is that it fits the current vibe of the chart perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1770750743134576s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>The EU is going full degen — 101 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856214</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856214?lm=1771178958</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 18:09:18 +0000</pubDate><description>Open article for full thread</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;The EU is going full degen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856214'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 101 • Updated: 2026-02-15 18:09 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Replies (oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856961&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856668&lt;br&gt;The good part is that if and when whitey is reduced to nothing there will be absolutely no unity left.

So what Ursula here is talking about is capital controls, forcing domestic savings into domestic investment sinks. This is not dissimilar to what China has going on, except Europeans don&amp;#x27;t have the right capital or population structure to justify domestic investment on that scale. They already have infrastructure and though we call them Europoors, they aren&amp;#x27;t nearly as destitute as the median Chinaman. It&amp;#x27;s going to be the malinvestment spectacle of the century if the EU actually manages to implement a regime to this effect, amidst some stiff competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857085&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214&lt;br&gt;The Great Taking begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857095&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857085&lt;br&gt;Shut the fuck up + you won&amp;#x27;t do shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857118&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856420&lt;br&gt;Go cry somewhere else faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857134&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857118&lt;br&gt;Ok suck israeli dick, Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857170&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214&lt;br&gt;wow literally the same exact faggotry as the cheetos mandatory savings account for children what a cohencidence!!!! still think the MIGA orange kike isnt deepstate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857184&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214&lt;br&gt;So the EU either steals from their people or it fails.&lt;br&gt;lol, muh powerful union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857196&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856542&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s seething libtards who hate Russia because they aren&amp;#x27;t nice to fags&lt;br&gt;I wish I was joking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857261&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856542&lt;br&gt;I can&amp;#x27;t wait for the US to pull all military support from the EU. Then we see the dominoes of all their socialized programs (which only exist because they outsource all military defense expenses to the US) start falling apart.&lt;br&gt;Imagine how much they start seething when they realize that they were in fact an American vassal state all along and never had any relevance on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857279&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214&lt;br&gt;so they want shit like in USA where you put money into something and hope that will be enough when you retire ? hahahaha, at this rate you need to save at minimum 1000 or more monthly if you want to survive in 30-40 years &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856288&lt;br&gt;stfu faggot you don&amp;#x27;t know shit&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;408 billions go yearly for Rente aka pensions, this is without healthcare who&amp;#x27;s 325 billions yearly, but a big portion of healthcare is used by boomers not by young people &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Welfare is 58 billions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857402&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214&lt;br&gt;Euros are so disgustingly cowardly I dont even care anymore&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kill your government or fuck off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857421&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I won&amp;#x27;t worry too much about this as the final push to piss of Europeans is happening. Soon western Europe will praise Poland and Hungary for their strong culture and nationalism.

Those who took the covid vax will be very upset that the entire covid panic was a fake like and they fell for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vaccinated going to get mad and take out the EU leaders and bankers.

Silver is at 65€ right now and they boldly lie about it saying silver is at 80€ in their prices. &lt;br&gt;Lmao, 65€ per oz and they&amp;#x27;re selling at 113€/oz while claiming they have a 10% premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857089&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857088&lt;br&gt;Their gold is often a very good price.

In its place was a silver screw. All the doctors told his mother that there was nothing they could do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like it or not, he was stuck with it . . . He was screwed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the years of growing up were real tough on him, as all who saw the screw made fun of him. He avoided leaving his house . . . And thus, never made any friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, a mysterious stranger saw his belly and told him of a monk in Tibet who could get rid of the screw for him. He was thrilled. The next day, he took all of his life&amp;#x27;s savings and bought a ticket to Nepal .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After several days of climbing up steep cliffs, he came upon a giant monastery. The monk knew exactly why he had come. The screwy guy was told to sleep in the highest tower of the monastery and the following day when he awoke, the screw would have been removed. The man immediately went to the room and fell asleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the night while he slept, a purple fog floated in an open window. In the mist floated a solid silver screwdriver. In just moments, the screwdriver removed the screw and disappeared out the window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next morning when the man awoke, he saw the silver screw laying on the pillow next to him. Reaching down, he felt his navel, and there was no screw there! Jubilant, he leaped out of bed . . . And his ass fell off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moral to this is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#x27;Don&amp;#x27;t screw around with things you don&amp;#x27;t understand -- You could lose your ass.&amp;#x27;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857228&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857180&lt;br&gt;In the UK Chards looks good imo. You have quite a few very good bullion dealers there;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857246&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857224&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857264&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856890&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;2053&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;he doesn&amp;#x27;t know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857267&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857088&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Stonexbullion&lt;br&gt;Yes. That dutch anon is recommending it all the time and it&amp;#x27;s a total scam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best options for europe are goldsilber.be, metalmarket and europeanmint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857271&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857267&lt;br&gt;I would add hollandgold too, but they are very sketchy with delivery times and their shipping costs are 80 euro (lol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857274&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;and just like that this edition of pmg met it&amp;#x27;s 10-20% quota for kike posters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857277&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost all countries have a tax about capital gain, you could try to avoid paying it if you don&amp;#x27;t want, but what stops me from going into a coin shop/bullion dealer and buying 5 oz of gold at the current price paying with my own 5 oz of gold that I bought back when it was sub 1k€ an ounce? &lt;br&gt;Wouldn&amp;#x27;t that reset my capital gain tax for the future at the current 4.2k€/oz therefore if I wanted to sell it the legit way reduce my tax burden?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857267&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;europeanmint&lt;br&gt;I bought some stuff from there back in 2015 but even back then they barely had any stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857280&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855742&lt;br&gt;did she respond?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857286&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857228&lt;br&gt;Is it wise to consider buying from their &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; coin range? The coins I&amp;#x27;m looking at are either out of stock or have quite a high premium, so now I&amp;#x27;m considering buying from the used bin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857288&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857284&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857284&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857284&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857284&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857289&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857267&lt;br&gt;Gildsilverbe seem goid I&amp;#x27;m gonna try them next year. My experience is only good so far with StoneX. Mainly they ship when promised and it arrives without stress. So far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857297&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857286&lt;br&gt;Well depends on how you want your coin. For example 1 ducat I prefer uncirculated.&lt;br&gt;But a Britannia or krugerrand id not mind circulated as long as the gold weight is ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857303&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857297&lt;br&gt;Would the gold weight not always match that of an uncirculated coin of the same type? 1oz sovereign used vs 1oz sovereign uncirculated? Unless chips and dents are on the coin eh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857289&lt;br&gt;Do you buy silver from there? Because they are charging 110 euro for silver coins. It&amp;#x27;s as if they haven&amp;#x27;t updated the website since the crash. For gold prices are more normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857398&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857224&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t think this is a true story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857524&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857309&lt;br&gt;I hardly buy any silver there no. As you say the prices aren&amp;#x27;t great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771105049951580s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>A Kalshi marked experienced a liquidity panic; whale gamblers got bailed out — 52 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849677</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849677?lm=1771179135</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 18:12:15 +0000</pubDate><description>Open article for full thread</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;A Kalshi marked experienced a liquidity panic; whale gamblers got bailed out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61849677'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 52 • Updated: 2026-02-15 18:12 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy shit!&lt;br&gt;$3.6 million market decided despite clear rules and video evidence!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a Mentions market based on the recent Bernie Sanders rally in Greensboro (on 2/12). Trading was ramping up before the event, with all of the typical Bernie triggers at 90% (Trump, socialism, immigration, corruption, billionaire, etc.). Pretty typical, low liquidity mentions market, maybe $400k. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the blink of an eye, it shoots ip to $1.5 million, as Kalshi began advertising it in their front page. I heard they also sent a text alert to users. This market would eventually balloon to $3.6 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m watching the prices and searching for a live stream. Maybe 10 minutes after the event started the prices begin to plummet. Not just a few positions; all Yes positions drop drastically to the bottom. Things that Sanders says in literally every speech he’s given in the last 20 years drop to below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Replies (oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850455&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850431&lt;br&gt;To me it&amp;#x27;s clear that at least in this case, the owners bet against other users. When they fucked up, they just said &amp;quot;didn&amp;#x27;t happen lol&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;The same thing as exchanges act as the market maker really. But if you manage to trick their algo and fuck them, they will just block your account for abuse or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850461&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850282&lt;br&gt;This is the first case I know of where the documented evidence (a video recording) was downright ignored. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been some shady wordings, like “what will trump say during his meeting with the President of Columbia?” Well, know one can know what was actually said because it was a closed-door meeting. There are media reports and press statements, but no actual record. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They began voiding markets though, like anything with Charlie Kirk after he was killed. And I think the Niki Minaj market was voided as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850471&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850439&lt;br&gt;You can gamble on the price of Bitcoin and it’s acktchually safer than buying bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850578&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850282&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849772&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850614&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849677&lt;br&gt;will you faggots stop looking for sympathy when these nebulous prediction markets don&amp;#x27;t work out for you. we don&amp;#x27;t give a fuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850649&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849729&lt;br&gt;betting in these gay prediction markets makes you extremely jewish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850653&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850461&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;This is the first case I know of where the documented evidence (a video recording) was downright ignored.&lt;br&gt;and it won&amp;#x27;t be the last&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850875&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850614&lt;br&gt;It’s an interesting case. It’s not personal; I’m not gonna sweat $6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850649&lt;br&gt;Please explain the decision fference between gambling in the price of silver going up or the chance of Taylor Swift getting married this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851319&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give me some good bets to make i just threw 100 bucks on this fucking app &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truly incredible how easy it is to set up. No ID or nothing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851319&lt;br&gt;its almost like it was built by kike intel agencies to steal and launder money or something. weird!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853737&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;seems like a shitco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853755&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854842&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851319&lt;br&gt;The are long term, short term, and medium term markets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short term would be ones that only last about a hour, such as “Will the price of Bitcoin be 66,500 or greater by 2pm?” Every one of those markets are actually broken down into 1,000 or 500 increments and you can gamble in each one. “Will BC be over 58,000 by 2pm?” That bet will have a very small returnif you buy Yes, and it resolves as Yes, because everyone will be betting Yes as well (because it’s very likely t to hat the price will be over 58k). Will it be over 69,750? Well, the price for those contracts can change drastically over the hour, as Bitcoin rises and falls in real time, hovering around that point, dipping above and below it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another short term bet are the mentions markets like in the OP. Some don’t open until the day of the event. But some are two or three days before. Sportsball games are often medium term as well, with prices changing in the lead up and during the games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s a week long “what will trump say this week” market that resets every Monday morning. Those can be lucrative if you can get in early (around 10am eastern time on Monday), buy the right positions, and have a little luck. For instance a No position on a term he hasn’t been using lately might be cheap at the start of the week but much more expensive as the week goes on. But you have to get in early, almost like an IPO. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are long term options that won’t resolve for weeks or months the, but they see very little movement unless the news changes. Who will be the Dem president rial nominee? Well, even if you’re right you won’t see a resolution until the DNC announces who it is in 2028. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could also stick with small bets on sportsball. It can be pretty safe if you pick 75%+ odds, and pay attention to the game so far if you’re betting on live action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854894&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849677&lt;br&gt;Tl;dr - in unregulated gambling the goyim thought they were out jewing the jew but the jew jewed them good.&lt;br&gt;Better luck next time goyim hehe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855391&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854842&lt;br&gt;Think of wins and losses as a percentage. “It’s only $3,” sure. But that’s 3% of your portfolio. That’s a huge loss. If you could sell now and make $0.25 on a $2 bet instead of risking a resolution, you made an 12.5% return. “It’s only $0.25,” sure, but it’s a substantial gain relative to the buy in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855406&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854894&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;unregulated&lt;br&gt;Why do you choose to operate on low information? Is it because you’re brown or just a regular retard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856379&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;these betting sites are scams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856388&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;How the fuck are predictions markets not regulated like online gambling? Is this some jewish trick or something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856496&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856388&lt;br&gt;The only one that isn’t regulated is Polymarket. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856379&lt;br&gt;Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856595&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850471&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;safer&lt;br&gt;No it’s not faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857072&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854842&lt;br&gt;I want long shots only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857106&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849678&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;COMEX IS GOING TO BLOW UP BECAUSE THEY&amp;#x27;RE OUT OF SILVER!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You guys really think you can win in some one else&amp;#x27;s casino?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857285&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850471&lt;br&gt;You have to be 18 to post here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857305&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849677&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849678&lt;br&gt;Well then their credibility tanks to zero and responsible people stop using their platform. I’d never heard of it so idc but I’m sorry for your loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857308&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849729&lt;br&gt;A 6 million dollar bet you say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857312&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850159&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850649&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851376&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854894&lt;br&gt;only a few gets it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857383&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857072&lt;br&gt;That’s simple; just do the opposite of what I said. Instead of playing it safe and betting Yes or No on Bitcoin being &amp;gt;69k by 1pm, but No on it being over 68,750. That position is ,12% right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bet that Trump won’t say IA next week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bet that the underdog will win the sportsball game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bet that Judy Shelton will be nominated as Fed Chair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bet that Washington DC will get more than 3” of snow this month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any market that’s a sure thing can also be a long shot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857285&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856595&lt;br&gt;You two faggots just found out that you can gamble on the price of Bitcoin and both of you had a feminine, emotional reaction. Buying Bitcoin is gambling. Gambling on Bitcoin allows bets to be hedged or metered against its actual price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857410&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857305&lt;br&gt;No one responsible is betting on kalshi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857464&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849677&lt;br&gt;You&amp;#x27;re only allowed to gamble when you lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857525&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849677&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been using Kalshi to find misspriced money lines and props, rolling them into some retarded 5 to 10 leg combos and making bank.

But considering alts didn&amp;#x27;t do shit and bitcoin had one of its weakest cumshots in its history, I think we&amp;#x27;ll probably see 40k, and wouldn&amp;#x27;t surprise me to see 20-30k. I can&amp;#x27;t think of any bullish narrative. Anyone who has money to burn on investing in novel tech is focused on AI, the &amp;#x27;store of value&amp;#x27; meme proved wrong considering gold has performed roughly the same or dramatically better since 2018, there are far better privacy coins like monero if you want to buy drugs, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where exactly is this huge surge of of buy pressure suppose to come from? We had institutional adoption, bitcoin ETFs, and it&amp;#x27;s even been shilled by the president, but it still couldn&amp;#x27;t break 150k. No fundamental thesis, it&amp;#x27;s just become a &amp;quot;line go up&amp;quot; cult at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854811&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let wait until December. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am expecting at least a 60% drop. Then crab with a few false bullrun until 2029. The next ATH will be just 170k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854832&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854755&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;gold has performed roughly the same or dramatically better since 2018&lt;br&gt;It hasn&amp;#x27;t though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855117&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of you niggers are factoring in the crypto assets bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855136&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854497&lt;br&gt;Thank god the bitcoin bubble is never q bubble, bitcoin has so many fucking uses and has been around for 14 years now and is a miracle to the financial world, a true cornerstone and founding part of all economies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855170&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853624&lt;br&gt;This.

AI video generation is insanely power consuming and we all know in the West the money came from stocks being over valued and loans. Where did chink companies get their money? Was it from the government? If so, wouldn&amp;#x27;t that massive spending spree make their government debt go up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856057&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852762&lt;br&gt;Well it&amp;#x27;s Tom Crusie after all.

This literally looks like every big budget blockbuster from the last decade.&lt;br&gt;Hollywood is totally fucked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856177&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856043&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;money&lt;br&gt;doesn&amp;#x27;t mean anything for the CPC.

AI won’t make good stuff, it will make shit that looks the same as kino that eventually destroys the association between “looking good” and “being good” that currently exists in people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857142&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854500&lt;br&gt;checked and based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857147&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone saying Seedance 2.0 isn’t a big deal should be ignored. They have no idea what they’re talking about. In a few years, one person will be able to create an entire movie. This is similar to decentralized media, where people like Joe Rogan get more viewers than CNN. Hollywood will stick around for a while, but they’ll cling to life similar to news outlets. This is actually the beginning of the end. If Hollywood hadn’t been so shitty since 2008, we wouldn’t be cheering for their demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857225&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fight scene existing for its own sake is such a tremendous immersion-break that I really don&amp;#x27;t mind it being killed off as a trope by sloppa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857283&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856043&lt;br&gt;Three gorges damn alone makes as much power as the entire USA does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857328&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857147&lt;br&gt;This&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve as already pieced together a couple movies that would deserve to win Oscars in previous years&lt;br&gt;The same thing will happen for all forms of art&lt;br&gt;People will cling to pre-2020 movies, music, games, paintings, etc. because it will be the last time when humans created anything with artistic value. I&amp;#x27;ve actually added about 30k in artwork over the past year for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856247&lt;br&gt;Yeah&lt;br&gt;I heard something is happening in 2 weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857516&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857147&lt;br&gt;Hollywood peaked at Tropic Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857536&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852484&lt;br&gt;the solution to the next AI phase of industrialization and commerce:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;the low cost labor country dominates all technology barriers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would that pop the bubble or keep things the same as they are right now? If China &amp;quot;owned&amp;quot; the latest and greatest tech, the Western world had to somehow struggle to achieve what they achieved. Would that be like re-inventing gunpowder? Is that the future or the past? It seems a little bit like wishful thinking that the low cost labor country would still have ANY relevance but what do I know, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857556&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good thing about this is someone will eventually remake the last 2 seasons of game of thrones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857558&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856177&lt;br&gt;you do understand where China&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;money supply&amp;quot; comes from, right?

Nothing can merge with BBBYQ because it no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857493&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857478&lt;br&gt;are you retarded or are you watching women&amp;#x27;s hockey like some faggot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857522&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;vous ne serez jamais un vrai québécois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857548&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857522&lt;br&gt;Sacrebleu!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857549&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857480&lt;br&gt;I actually don&amp;#x27;t think it even makes sense to expect Lemonis to do anything other than to deny what is happening. To even write such a post is actually stupid. &lt;br&gt;The truth is the only thing that matters is the CUSIP. If BBBYQ shares were dead and gone, the warrants would have been issued using Overstock/BYON/BBBY&amp;#x27;s CUSIP. But they do not. They have BBBYQs CUSIP. This is the most jarring fact we have to go on right now. It proves on a 100% proven factual basis that BBBYQ reverse merged with BBBYQ. It already happened. The &amp;quot;Butterfly&amp;quot; in DK Butterfly was all about splitting off the shell so that the BK protections could be maximized while Lemonis continued the operations. Once we are done with CH11 the operations and the shell will be disclosed to have recombined. We know this because it already happened. The CUSIP would not be on BBBY&amp;#x27;s warrants otherwise. &lt;br&gt;These warrants were released on the same date as GME&amp;#x27;s warrants. GME&amp;#x27;s CEO is apart of the BBBYQ CH11 process. &lt;br&gt;Towelkings will inherit MOASS. This is bigger than GME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857551&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember. Shills hate being called slurs call anyone who seems shilly as many slurs as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857564&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857480&lt;br&gt;OOOO Mr Lemonpiss you are such a good CEO.

Concern trolls want to Crypost but their caustic concerns completely crumble by the confirmation of the CUSIP Confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854722&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854641&lt;br&gt;there is also a conundrum concerning a certain creditor to the company :o)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854941&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854722&lt;br&gt;Checked. Who could it be? What does it all mean?!?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont care.&lt;br&gt;I dont cafè&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855287&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003&lt;br&gt;This goes to show you just how dumb and disingenuous the silly shillies are. You can ask Goldberg whatever the hell you want but he is not obligated to give you a truthful answer when M&amp;amp;A is involved. He wouldn&amp;#x27;t tell you so this is completely useless. &lt;br&gt;This still does not solve the CUSIP Conundrum. Words only get you so far, but right here right now in 2026 there are open Bed Bath and Beyond stores and the company that operates them is not even using the Overstock/BYON/BBBY CUSIP. They issued new securities in October using BBBYQs CUSIP. &lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s already proven 100% fact that a reverse merger of the BBBYQ shell has already occurred with BBBY. There is zero counterargument. &lt;br&gt;Overstock, BYON and BBBY all kept them same CUSIP. So why now does it suddenly switch? Occams Razor solves the puzzle: BBBYQ shell reverse merger has already occured and the details are not in any known docket.&lt;br&gt;BBBY mystery has been solved by yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855551&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003&lt;br&gt;Mayhaps DK-Butterfly and DK-Butterfly1 are different entities.

I, too, will accidentally add on a -1 for no reason. This speculative theories are bizarre-1. See! Haha, I did it on accident just now. I can&amp;#x27;t even believe I did that LOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855697&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856432&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855697&lt;br&gt;I dont care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hallo?&lt;br&gt;When BBBY return? &lt;br&gt;I dont care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857266&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857014&lt;br&gt;BBBY is trading now.

Shorts are also cancel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857530&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853518&lt;br&gt;BBBY and gme sagas have been incredibly illuminating for me&lt;br&gt;I always thought that it is at least *possible* for rational actors to creatively misunderstand evidence disproving legacy conspiracies like flat earth&lt;br&gt;but for meme stocks it&amp;#x27;s all completely dry corporate and legal documents explicitly formulated in such a way that there&amp;#x27;s nothing to misunderstand&lt;br&gt;meme stocks gave me a new understanding of the strength of people&amp;#x27;s delusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857546&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857528&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857530&lt;br&gt;What do you guys think about DK-Butterfly&amp;#x27;s CUSIP matching the new BBBY warrants?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you guys think about GME needing to recognize a loss on a security they never sold?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you guys think about Gustavo Arnal being murdered in cold blood for helping RC?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you guys think about there being no final decree yet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bet you have a lot to say about it on a Sunday morning don&amp;#x27;t you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857565&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857313&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;There is zero counterargument.&lt;br&gt;I am sorry. But there is no answer to the CUSIP Conundrum. What else am I to believe other than the thesis that CH11 for BBBYQ would end in a transaction. We now have evidence that this transaction took place. You just don&amp;#x27;t like that I harp on it and won&amp;#x27;t let it go. &lt;br&gt;You are just a grumpy wumpy seethy weethy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1770327356756880s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>/pmg/ - Precious Metals General — 66 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61857284</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61857284?lm=1771179919</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 18:25:19 +0000</pubDate><description>Open article for full thread</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;/pmg/ - Precious Metals General&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61857284'&gt;Open thread&lt;/a&gt; • Replies: 66 • Updated: 2026-02-15 18:25 UTC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiener appreciation edition&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Why precious metals?&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/i3S4rl6ehiI&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/gksenA5Al_A&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/FI7NnOg2rxo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Huge deficits in minerals such as silver by 2050 inevitable&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/iibsrDXdEos&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Bullion dealers&lt;br&gt;https://libertycoin.com/ (US)&lt;br&gt;https://www.chards.co.uk/ (EU/UK)&lt;br&gt;https://www.silburycoins.co.uk/ (Ancient)&lt;br&gt;https://www.luciteria.com/ (Other rare metals)&lt;br&gt;https://www.ma-shops.com/ (Numismatics)&lt;br&gt;https://www.goldeneaglecoin.com/ (US)&lt;br&gt;https://stoutgold.co/ (US)&lt;br&gt;https://www.aydincoins.com/ (US)&lt;br&gt;https://prospectorsgoldandgems.com/ (US)&lt;br&gt;more at:https://pastebin.com/gZfZHtNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Numismatic search&lt;br&gt;https://en.numista.com/catalogue&lt;br&gt;https://www.ngccoin.com/price-guide/world&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;News and graphs&lt;br&gt;https://numismag.com/en/home-en&lt;br&gt;https://silverseek.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.silverdoctors.com&lt;br&gt;https://www.mining.com&lt;br&gt;https://silverbacksnakes.io/finance/silver&lt;br&gt;https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-reserves-by-country&lt;br&gt;https://wtfhappenedin1971.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Compare&lt;br&gt;https://findbullionprices.com (US)&lt;br&gt;https://eu.compare.pm (EU)&lt;br&gt;https://www.gold.de/aufgeldtabelle (DE/EU)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Resources&lt;br&gt;https://www.jmbullion.com/ultimate-guide-to-90-silver-coins&lt;br&gt;https://kevinsworkbench.com/junksilverguide&lt;br&gt;https://www.coinflation.com&lt;br&gt;http://coinapps.com&lt;br&gt;https://erikasgrig.com/calculators/rpi-calculator-inflation&lt;br&gt;https://learn.apmex.com/buying-guide/buying-in-the-usa&lt;br&gt;https://pastebin.com/5aLmWUUK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Prospecting&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/ZCL6FKQZyoM&lt;br&gt;https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science&lt;br&gt;https://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/en/news/mines-and-minerals&lt;br&gt;https://www.amazon.ca/Gold-Creeks-Ghostowns-British-Columbia/dp/088839988X&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Nitric acid, magnets, and ping test&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/3mg9YcAShTo&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/NgSXg-WOEVY&lt;br&gt;https://youtu.be/2ymGAyKAg-k&lt;br&gt;https://www.fakebullion.com/index.php/resources/fake-bullion-database&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Silver Hallmarks Encyclopedia&lt;br&gt;https://www.925-1000.com/&lt;br&gt;https://www.silvercollection.it/hallmarks.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous thread: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Replies (oldest → newest)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857433&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857420&lt;br&gt;Americans have no taste, everything they touch turns into plastic cheese.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We used to be good until we imported 50 million jeets. Our coins will probably look worse than american coins in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857435&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857420&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;how shameful to ruin the natural beauty of silver with this horrendous design&lt;br&gt;Not gonna lie, it&amp;#x27;s a pretty cool business card concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857437&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857419&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;They sprayed Vietnam jungles with it&lt;br&gt;How do they spray a jungle with a guy called Orange?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857441&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m wanting to buy something although it&amp;#x27;s probably best to just wait until coins are back in stock. However, out of these two, which would you go for? 1992 Maple 0.1 oz 24 carat, or a 2023 half sovereign with Charles crowned (916.67)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857444&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857433&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Americans have no taste, everything they touch turns into plastic cheese.&lt;br&gt;Not gonna lie, I would probably like government cheese.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we talk about stores of value, collectables aren&amp;#x27;t the best things. Harley&amp;#x27;s used to be worth $30k, but the only people who really liked them were boomers, and there&amp;#x27;s a huge glut of unsold new Harleys that are rotting in the sun because boomers are trading their bikes in for mobility scooters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gold and silver make the best store of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857447&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theres a massive storm outside, I am going to make a cup of tea, smoke cannabis, and count my silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857450&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857433&lt;br&gt;your coins are objectively worse than ours because they portray the likeness of reptilian archons and a dumb leaf. ours have a sick ass eagle and the beautiful embodiment of liberty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857451&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857420&lt;br&gt;The funniest silver I got is the Wall Street Bets silver squeeze ape. Very rare. unfortunately most people in the future will not get the joke on your bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;wish me luck guise, auction ends in 30 mins, ive bid 60€&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857456&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857447&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m jelly, I miss pot. It&amp;#x27;s been 6 years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chat, is this true?&lt;br&gt;https://x.com/howie4317694102/status/2022731732450267274&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857468&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857458&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I would not get anything with Charles on it.&lt;br&gt;I did. One has no choice if one wants to buy a new Maple from the LCS. I don&amp;#x27;t like any of the lizards, but I would prefer younger Lizzie to the crypto muslim lizard king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857471&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;chat,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;screenshot of someone complaining about the difficulty of using 4chan, on twitter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know 4chan isn&amp;#x27;t some big secret anymore but this place really is flooded with normies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857472&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857458&lt;br&gt;i ordered a sovereign (random assortment) and received the objectivly worst ugly rosé colored one with the banner on front and charles on the back. i hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857479&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857460&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857471&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s really gone to hell ever since they required you to upload a photo of your ID and a dick pic before posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857481&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857437&lt;br&gt;Orange you glad they didn&amp;#x27;t use banana?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857482&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857450&lt;br&gt;The new eagle design looks better. That old shield eagle just reminds me of the Rothschilds. It is supposed to be an eagle landing on a branch but it is so small that it looks like the eagle is picking it up for literal nest eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857484&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857322&lt;br&gt;$45 by the end Monday night&lt;br&gt;$5 by Friday night&lt;br&gt;$0 by next Monday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857498&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;only oldfags will understand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857502&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857484&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;$0 by next Monday&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;ll take 12 million ounces please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857509&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857437&lt;br&gt;The same way Dr. Evil sprays the cleanest bathrooms full of fecal matter with Agent #2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857511&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857498&lt;br&gt;Yes, does remind me of something. Something involving a goat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857518&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857509&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m imagining a C-130 with a platoon of jeets squatting on the cargo ramp as the plane flies overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857523&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857502&lt;br&gt;So he&amp;#x27;s done buying? :(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857341&lt;br&gt;Fantastic coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857541&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857444&lt;br&gt;if you like a good cheddar then itd be ok. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857468&lt;br&gt;thats a solid 2/10. her young profile coins look hot and i refuse to believe she was the model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857554&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, Tengu&amp;#x27;s steal gold and children.... Is anyone else noticing a pattern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857541&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;thats a solid 2/10.&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a harsh score, you should see her sister. Post what you think is a 9/10 so we know how long your ruler is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857560&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857481&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eggstein&amp;#x27;s investment guy pitched silver to him but he did not seem interested, asking instead about a real estate opportunity in St Tropez. The email was dated May 17th 2011. Did he know something the investment guy didn&amp;#x27;t?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I have also enclosed some research I made on the silver market and I am fully convinced that a squeeze is possible if one can take delivery of 100% of the futures contract. The squeeze caused by the five increase in margins requirements only squeezed the week hands. I think that silver without undue speculation will end the year at $60 and that its inflation adjusted value is $150.-. It is also likely that the gold to silver ratio will fall under 20 from the current 40 within the next 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61857572&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;GUISE i got it for 35€&lt;br&gt;didnt even try to calc any silver value but just the historical artefacts alone are nice. Wouldnt evn consider melting them&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61857454&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</content:encoded><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771175124476176s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item></channel></rss>
