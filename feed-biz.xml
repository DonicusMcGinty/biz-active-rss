Yes, in East Caribbean Dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854630:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;it actually reinvested near the day&amp;#x27;s low which is a nice surprise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854639:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854583
&amp;gt;asks a robot to argue for him
&amp;gt;accuses the other party of not knowing anything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854640:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#x27;m hyperbullish if we don&amp;#x27;t go below 60 during Chinese New Year, either way I win&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854659:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853347
oh look a cuck poster who glazes the Jewish financial system for cheating the price of silver. right or wrong you&amp;#x27;re a cuck either way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854683:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854191
why did they take bro&amp;#x27;s dvd player. how is he going to watch spiderman 2

Also that guy had too many guns and bullets, and not enough silver.
I&amp;#x27;m glad I didnt get gun autism. I would have wasted so much money. Just a couple was good enough for me.
Very happy that I got addicted to silver and books instead.

Also also , I agree with the anon warning other about junk silver. I&amp;#x27;ve tried to warn them too, but obviously the anons who are heavy in junk flip out.
The only way I would buy junk would be if it was under 50% spot and I already had a make it stack. Saving 15-20% isnt worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854688:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853766
I mean it’s obviously a given they wouldn’t know what comex is. Nobody would fault even a current college kid in the middle of his finance degree not knowing what comex is.

I just thought it was funny to throw something in there that they wouldn’t know about, then add in everyone will be destitute for effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854711:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852403
how has this not been turned into one of those ai images where they both have that confused look on their faces with cat ears yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854725:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852544
the type of gold depends on the location is this california? nevada? alaska? pans are cheap and easy but i wouldnt invest in other shit until you know what type of gold you are looking for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854729:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854639
&amp;gt;trying to dispute facts with &amp;quot;it&amp;#x27;s a robot&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854736:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853993
do you have a stick just so you can sit there and poke your stack with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854743:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hate to break it to you all but nothing is going to happen to the price of silver this year. Unless legal action is taken against bankers they will just keep naked shorting and spoofing to keep the price down. This allows them to
1. profit massively off their shorts
2. cover their previous retarded short positions
3. buy silver at cheaper than market value
Everything bankers are doing is completely illegal and will keep the price within the ranges that JP Morgan &amp;quot;predicted&amp;quot; for the year $75-$85 anything over/under these prices since the first gigadump if you haven&amp;#x27;t noticed has rebounded in this range exactly where jpm wants it.

This isn&amp;#x27;t fud this is a fact. These bankers have the power to get together and smash the price of silver in minutes negating the entirety of our collective investing power.

It doesn&amp;#x27;t matter if there&amp;#x27;s no silver and huge demand. It did previously not anymore not in the western world. Bankers have 100% control of the prices and it&amp;#x27;s completely illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854746:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854736
you use it to see if the coins are real on not gold and silver when you ping them do a specific sound that other metals can&amp;#x27;t recreate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854750:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please wait until my taxes come back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854752:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854743
Fuckin fud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854765:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854750
this fud &amp;quot;muh taxes&amp;quot; poster is jewish
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853764
I remember you. You said you are jewish. Now it makes sense.
OY VEY he found out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854769:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854743
ive bought at face value, ive bought at 50, ive bought at 70, ive bought at 120, ive bought at 80

im gonna buy no matter what so it really doesnt matter much to me

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854750
??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854774:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854765
what did i find out im confused&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854776:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854596
Joke&amp;#x27;s on you, fren! I&amp;#x27;ve acquired my entire stack of goldbacks for the low, low price of $Free.99. It was literally free gold. Keep talking shit, retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854777:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854583
Haha, now enter &amp;quot;for the month of march&amp;quot;, and then shut up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854780:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854769
You&amp;#x27;re running against the entire Jewish financial system at this point and they&amp;#x27;ve already shown their hands -- they won. Nothing will change these facts unless the powers that be are willing to take action against the banks which they won&amp;#x27;t because it will cause financial ruin and most of them are in their pockets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854791:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854780
Shalom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854795:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854729
Well, both of you are uneducated retards that like watching 10 min YouTube videos making each of you certified experts on the matter. Now do his input but specifying the month of march, you will find the highest % of delivery has been 13.5% in march of 2021 during the silver squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854798:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854780
the jewish financial system is provide for your children

my family has always stacked silver and done trade work. we&amp;#x27;ve never held gold or been bankers or any typical jewish profession. my great grandpa was a baker, that might be the closest. 

My familys traditionally hedged against inflation and saved money buying guns, but now Im putting way more in silver because i think thats a smart choice. my dad is stacking silver seriously now too. I think it&amp;#x27;s a good investment, I couldn&amp;#x27;t give a damn about &amp;quot;jewish bankers&amp;quot; somewhere in a big city I don&amp;#x27;t know. I really couldnt give a fuck especially about any israeli financial interests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854800:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sleep great not owning silver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854805:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854800
Check&amp;#x27;d that&amp;#x27;s because you sleep in a bed of fecal matter which is by your genetic determinism as peak comfy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854807:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854777
Checked. Here you go retard. Open up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854808:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854798
Silver is a stablecoin as long as bankers get to illegally control the price. It&amp;#x27;s not a good or bad investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854815:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owning anything taxable is retarded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854816:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854743
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854780
lol, lmao even
They can&amp;#x27;t even get it back to $20-30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854820:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854808
absolutely

that&amp;#x27;s why it&amp;#x27;s a good investment. 1 ozt will always be 1 ozt no matter what. I do think silver is undervalued right now by a good bit. We&amp;#x27;ll see in the coming year or two. who knows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854824:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854807
the happening is upon us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854825:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854816
They&amp;#x27;re not trying to. Supply and demand keeps the price in the ranges they want which is based on the value of their own silver stockpile. The lowest we may see is $50-60 and it won&amp;#x27;t last for more than a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854835:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854743
&amp;gt;Everything bankers are doing is completely illegal
For goyim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854841:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854583
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854807
Oof. What is 2-8? Anon says it&amp;#x27;s a positive number. Our eyes must be deceiving. You aren&amp;#x27;t looking at the truth.

Lol lmao even&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854872:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854765
what % of posters here are jewish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854886:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854807
Jesus Christ your dumb, https://discoveryalert.com.au/comex-silver-default-possibility-market-analysis-2026/
Your own source says it&amp;#x27;s usually between 0.5-2%, and speculates that there&amp;#x27;s a 98% probability the delivery will be 5% for march of 2026. You straight up trust what a retarded niggerbot tells you? Click the fucking links retard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854893:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854807
And no matter how much you dumb bot says it&amp;#x27;s average 18-22% reality is 0.5-2% stand for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854895:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854872
from what i&amp;#x27;ve seen pmg is at least 10%-20% jewish, myself included&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854938:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854895
Jewanon, are Jews really g-d&amp;#x27;s chosen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854949:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854938
You tell me, apparently jews are not allowed to type out the full word god?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854964:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where is baker?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854972:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854835
No they&amp;#x27;ll get caught eventually and rope like Epstein ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854976:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854964
&amp;gt;Where is baker?

great so we can have the next edition of pmg filled with uninvited kikes and jeets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855016:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854976

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856366:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I have about six kilos of 925 jewelry, amassed over the years. What the hell do I do with it? Just put it away? Have it melted down into bars? Sell it? First time poster obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856480:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854776

i invest in whatever is currently mooning so i know i get the most valuable asset&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855966:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855956
Mfw I got a half ounce years ago for 16 and it just sits there in my water bottle to keep the water clean...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855970:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;lets say I have cash and dont want any more. 

when I cash out say $10,000 in gold eagles, and the cash shop ACHs my account, do I have to declare that in my tax next year? The bank dosent report this transaction to the gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855972:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855970
pay your taxes goy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855974:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855901
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855901
You were right!
He does that thing with his mouth all the time and the wrinkles in various photos matched. 
I had trouble matching his nose, but I think this photo shows it well.

Very surprising that his name doesn&amp;#x27;t pop up any more. It lines up with this round being released in 2023
Thank you so much, I would have never found it as it seems they did their best to scrub it.

Too bad for him it&amp;#x27;s immortalized in silver.
Pretty sure this is correct now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855976:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855970
You only pay tax on the capitol gains, and the amount taken out for capitol gains is factored against previous earnings and losses. 
&amp;gt;The bank dosent report this transaction to the gov.
You seriously think that 10 thousand in gold isn&amp;#x27;t being reported to the gov by either your coin shop, the bank, or anyone else and that it won&amp;#x27;t get caught by the IRS? Don&amp;#x27;t be stupid for poorbux

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855963
just hit the roulette table at this point&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855977:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;im gonna buy more silver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855982:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855934
Google is your friend. It is well known that &amp;quot;John Roberts&amp;quot; was a passenger on the Lolita Express. There are even photos of the log. Now, of course, John Roberts is a pretty common name and I&amp;#x27;m sure its one of the thousands of anonymous, completely unimportant John Roberts and not an up and coming federal judge (at that time) who moves and navigates amongst the rich, powerful, and famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855984:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855686
literally bought 2 ase&amp;#x27;s off them that delivered today

free shipping and no tax. im sorry anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855985:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855952
That only works if we still have stores of it at Fort Knox and etc. and it isn&amp;#x27;t part of other countries&amp;#x27; reserves. Otherwise, it will harm us. The exports are repatriations from the US of gold from other countries for the most part and I don&amp;#x27;t think the export data cares about the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856000:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855559
But that&amp;#x27;s a two-ounce round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856001:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855974
I&amp;#x27;m out of the loop, why are you trying to match names to faces on the coin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856002:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855974
It checks out. The whole world knows that John Roberts (appointed by Bush after the murder of Justice Scalia, as chronicled in Podesta&amp;#x27;s wikileaks hack of his gmail account) was a cultivated plant, a crypto justice. His freakishly close relationship with Boasberg, an America hating communist Judge (apparently), and his hatred of Trump being well known, it just checks out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856005:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856001
Autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856007:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856001
Because I wanted to buy it (i did). 
It was pretty expensive, so I wanted to know all the names.

Here is some cool funny silver to make up for all the epstein coin posts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856012:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856002
&amp;gt;Trump
epstein #1 customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856015:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855974
That does kinda look like Spacey but he doesn&amp;#x27;t match the degree of power the others have. Spacey&amp;#x27;s victims who filed suit against him are all dead but he is broke signing autographs at conventions and singing in nightclubs in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856020:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856012
Yeah, OK, whatever your twisted mind wants to believe is fine with me, Mr Shekelberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856023:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856020
nice to know you&amp;#x27;re listening, goy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856027:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856015
yes, I thought it was odd to put spacey in there with those other people.
but look at the mouth and chin wrinkles. the forehead and eye bags.
 i think it&amp;#x27;s him, but i&amp;#x27;m willing to update it if you can find a better match.

maybe because this was made in 2023 it made more sense back then to put him there. high profile and he was in the news a bunch back then for all the gay stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856075:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855813&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856096:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856075
lol this is what the goyim actually believe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856121:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855977&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856127:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855970

In 1980 petrodollar kike empire has only started its grow. USSR was on border to collapse and China was absolutely irrelevant.
Now it&amp;#x27;s absolutely vise versa. You lost, kike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856316:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crazy there are shills against rock collectors. Hmmmmmmm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856333:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855333

oh you dont like ai. ok

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqJ7T8sQ_pM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856380:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s try this again. So I have about six kilos of 925 jewelry, amassed over the years. What the hell do I do with it? Just keep it tucked away? Have it melted down into bars? Sell it? First time poster obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856381:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856345
https://youtube.com/shorts/HbUbRyyn6h4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856383:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855985
&amp;gt;That only works if we still have stores of it at Fort Knox and etc
It works (and is necessary) even if the USA has zero gold.

From the POV of revaluing (devaluing) the dollar vs gold, it doesn&amp;#x27;t matter if the US has 8500 tons or not. Devaluing the dollar is needed to increase American export competiveness. Even if they still had 8500 tons of bars, it would only provide $5 trillion at best, which will soon be merely the annual deficit.

The devaluation of the dollar means the debt gets paid back via much smaller dollars. It is exactly the equivalent of a soft default, paying back 20% of the original value owed.

There is a 100% chance the US dollar will be devalued, the only question is:
-will it be a deliberate, finite, one time big jump
-will it be uncontrolled, ad hoc, chaotic and potentially unlimited

They probably still have a bunch of &amp;quot;coin bars&amp;quot; which are 90% gold that would be re-refined up to .999. This is what the &amp;quot;show off&amp;quot; to visiting politicians who are too stupid to know better.

The only reason why they would still have their coin bars is because if they tried to steal and sell them, any refiner on earth would immediate recognize these came from Fort Knox, so unlike regular fine gold, they couldn&amp;#x27;t be sold without publicly exposing the theft. The USA has probably been discreetly buying gold ever since they suddenly stopped talking about doing an audit.

As Luke Gromen says:
&amp;gt;All Roads Lead to Gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856387:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856383
&amp;gt;This is what they &amp;quot;show off&amp;quot; to visiting politicians and the media who are too stupid to know better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856390:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856380
&amp;gt;Just keep it tucked away?
For now yes. Refiners can&amp;#x27;t take it right now, so you would get raped because of refinery bottlenecks. You&amp;#x27;ve held it for years why is it suddenly burning a hole in your pocket.

If you insist on being raped, I would gladly pay you 50% of spot if we could meet in person in a public place and I could give you physical cash for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856401:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856380
Tuck it away. Refiners are back logged and you will just get raped by fees. Plus its better if your looking at it from a liquidity point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856408:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856183
This one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856453:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856408
No, but thanks still.
It was vertical, with many tiers throughout history.

&amp;gt;2025 75:1 (with a clown face)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856473:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I pick up my latest package I will sit at a modest 350oz of silver. How retarded am I if I use 60% of my q4 shipping divvies coming in a few weeks to buy an oz of gold at ~5% over spot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856484:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856473
not as retarded as me for just getting started in precious metals. Should have done this years ago, I&amp;#x27;ve always loved this stuff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856519:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856453&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856534:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856473
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856484
think of it like this. You can pay for silver now and feel stupid. But by the end of 2028 silver will be unobtanium. And thats when the mainstream normie NPC&amp;#x27;s are going to start getting in on it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856539:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856383
&amp;gt;There is a 100% chance the US dollar will be devalued, the only question is:
&amp;gt;-will it be a deliberate, finite, one time big jump
&amp;gt;-will it be uncontrolled, ad hoc, chaotic and potentially unlimited

As this guy said nvidia will post blowout earnings and it will still drop. That’s just a buying opportunity, the market is irrational but that doesn’t mean you have to be . So lower your average cost by buying the dip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856116:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will never be rich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856140:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856116
What would you even do with your investments if you were to get rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856153:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856140
I used to live around a lot of rich kids who just wanted a comfy beach bum life. Small apt, cheap car, some surfing, relaxing, drinking. No stress no mansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856159:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856153
I need at least a miata&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856197:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853891
Will this become true as this guy forecasted in 19,20,21,22,23,24,25?
He isn&amp;#x27;t an oracle or something but this guy seems to constantly make right predictions.
I can&amp;#x27;t tell who this guy is due to some reasons but you can always try searching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856199:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;needed a link to a download archive
&amp;gt;imageboard culture used to be a great repository for this kind of pirate culture
&amp;gt;some fag tells me to &amp;#x27;get a job to pay for youtube premium bro&amp;#x27;
I am so tired of the paypiggie normalfag invasion. All the fags who say &amp;#x27;normie&amp;#x27; and will always defend the trillion dollar corporation need to kill themselves immediately. We&amp;#x27;re now more than halfway through the 2020s and this is the worst decade of the internet ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856207:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856199
did you get what you need bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856220:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856199
I pay for youtube premium just for the ease of use. The app that I would use to watch YouTube on my phone was too unstable so I just gave in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856234:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856207
I did. But the most obnoxious shit is when some normalfag who is proud to have 500 bucks in his checking is like &amp;quot;you don&amp;#x27;t want to spend 10 bucks on a download, bro?&amp;quot;. Like what are you retarded, I obviously have 10 bucks. It&amp;#x27;s very brown coded to think spending money frivolously is a sign of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856241:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856234
it&amp;#x27;s just annoying background noise, actually a lot of noise can be beneficial to keep those juicy archieves hidden in plain sight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856243:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856111
Yeah it will obviously rug at earnings and bring down the whole market with it, but when does it fucking go up again? It&amp;#x27;s been stuck in the same range for a year now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856248:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855729

The 20k allowance resets every year in April. So you&amp;#x27;ve got like 2 months to fill another 15k. Then your allowance is reset and you can put in another 20k for the new tax year. Repeat over a few years, plus growth from the investments, and you can be sitting on a pretty big pile that is all tax free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856495:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856490
it is priced as if it going bankrupt
think about the deep value of a company full of women
they can just upload pictures of themselves and there you go the company is profitable again

holy shit anon, nice bag, I&amp;#x27;m barely a master sergeant and you&amp;#x27;ve basically hit 2nd lieutenant if that&amp;#x27;s your entire XRP bag and i&amp;#x27;m reading it right, congrats, now close it and waste it all on hookers and blow, we can&amp;#x27;t be having too many new millionaires from the black swan event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854951:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854921
No I just gambled like 700xrp 50x on the biggest long MEXC would let me have (since they limit coin futures positions) my overall stack is about 25k so from time to time I like to throw a little at a gamble when I feel like we are about to reverse. If I closed now I would get back my 716xrp + the 2368 coin futures are a little weird but I would rather be +xrp than +usdt at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855093:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852447

Look at the 3 month chart here:
https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationHeatMap?coin=XRP
Pic related.

If you hover your cursor over the bright lines, you can see where the greatest concentrations of liquidations will occur.
This gives you an idea of where they&amp;#x27;ll eventually take XRP&amp;#x27;s price to.
If you look at the liquidation chart as a whole, there is a lot more to be gained by exchanges liquidating shorts, then there are from liquidating longs.
There are about 8 or 9 times as much liquidity in liquidating all of the shorts, vs the longs.

But, the market manipulators can never be counted on to do what we expect.
Even though there&amp;#x27;s not much liquidity left to liquidate from the longs, they may still dip down the price to liquidate all the longs.
There is a decent sized cluster waiting to be liquidated at $1.34; which is below the point at which you would get liquidated.

Unrelated to your question, this 3 month liquidation heatmap for XRP makes me hopeful for future price action.
Worse case scenario is that they crab XRP sideways for months to lure in more longs, so they can dump it again.
However, it seems like they&amp;#x27;ve pulled that trick one too many times on the crypto investing public.
People&amp;#x27;s quality of life, due to sustained inflation, has been degrading more and more each year.
Combine that with people wising up to the crooked casino manipulation of crypto, and the net result is far less people putting their money into crypto.
And the ones still investing, have less disposable income to invest.

Institutional adoption is going to be the only major new source of money entering crypto.
Retail is rapidly drying up.
When the casino runs out of new victims to rob, they have no choice but to move to the next stage of their game.
I won&amp;#x27;t put a date on this, but I&amp;#x27;m optimistic about us seeing something good pricewise in the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855233:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been holding 500 XRP since 2020. Am I going to make it or should I just commit suicide tonight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855245:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855231
okay so 2.10 got it. Also you will notice that I have an in profit stop loss at 1.42 so I won&amp;#x27;t get liquidated in this position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855260:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855245
Yeah, I think $2.10 is where they&amp;#x27;ll take us to next.
Possible with a brief detour to $1.34 first.
I suspect that everything below that, are the various exchanges&amp;#x27; longs against each other.
But I doubt it will be a straight line up.
We&amp;#x27;ll likely get several pauses and pull back along the way.

&amp;gt;Also you will notice that I have an in profit stop loss at 1.42 so I won&amp;#x27;t get liquidated in this position.
I missed that.
You&amp;#x27;re smart anon.
Let&amp;#x27;s just hope that the exchange is honorable enough to let your stop loss, and they don&amp;#x27;t have an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; where it fails to trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855293:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855260
Mexc has been pretty good at not fucking me over like kucoin used to so that&amp;#x27;s nice. I don&amp;#x27;t really gamble too much so even if it did liquidate it&amp;#x27;s only like .03% of the stack at the end of the day plus I figure unless it goes in a super straight line down 1.42 gives some slippage wiggle even if it were to close at like 1.41 or something. I normally have a couple grid bots running to capitalize on overall long term volatility and then throw in some big gambas on payday. Nice thing is at the moment no fees and negative funding on MEXC so this is almost free money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855304:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855233
If XRP reaches a price of $589, you would only have $294,500.
That&amp;#x27;s nowhere near enough to make it.

I recall years ago, several anons in XSG pushing hard that XRP would definitely reach $2k, and even some pushing for $10k.
I&amp;#x27;m guessing you bought into $2k happening, since 500 x 589 = 1 million.
Anyone questioning them was insulted and mocked for doubting those numbers.
Could we still reach them?
Maybe.
But I doubt it, and wouldn&amp;#x27;t count on it happening.

The advantage of having a larger stack of XRP, is you don&amp;#x27;t need it to reach $2k or 10k to make it.
In before &amp;gt;you&amp;#x27;ll sell your whole stack early and want to rope when we go higher.
No, I&amp;#x27;ll sell in stages on the way up.
Basically, you need a larger stack.
Instead of roping, buy more XRP.
You could either buy now, or set a limit buy order for $1.34.
Either way is a gamble, but it&amp;#x27;s a lot cheaper than where we were a few months ago.

You still have time to accumulate.
Try to get as much as you can, but aim for at least 10k.
Even if you don&amp;#x27;t reach that, more is better than less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855315:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855304
&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;m guessing you bought into $2k happening, since 500 x 589 = 1 million.
Dammit.
Meant to say 500 x 2000 = 1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855469:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whats the old XSG saying

Q&amp;#x27;s real
Trump Won
XRP 2K EOY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855499:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855304
you guys still unironically listen to this unorganic ripple-sponsored faggit? your full-time job is delivering copium and hopium to bots and indians and zoomers. what a fucking loser lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855521:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855469
Q is Operation Trust 2.0.
https://jamestown.substack.com/p/the-trust-lives-moscow-uses-early

Trump is a puppet of the World Economic Forum.
His job is to destroy the old political and economic system.
To pave the way for the Technocracy.
A.I. governance and mass surveillance.
Social credit scores.
15 minute cities.
Carbon tax.
CBDCs (but they&amp;#x27;ll have a different name).

He&amp;#x27;ll expose all of the corruption of government, and is also a part of the corruption.
Trump is destroying the people&amp;#x27;s faith in our Republic.
Pedophiles go unpunished and remain in positions of great power, wealth, and influence.
He gets angry when questioned about it; or mocks the question.
No more hiding.
A raw display of the corruption.

The system is meant to break.
Not to restore justice and fairness, but to replace it with automated enslavement.
With A.I. ruling over us, they won&amp;#x27;t have to micro manage everything anymore.
They can kick back and relax while we become slaves.
Trump is meant to capture the minds of those who see through the initial layer of deception, but fail to see the next layer.

https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/ice-immigrant-detention-warehouses-spending
Ice is planning to spend $38 billion on mega jails.
Why do they need these, if they are just going to deport the illegals?
The jails are for us.
Look at the millions of dollars Trump is giving to Palantir to spy on us.
Wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855523:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855499
idk piss snake poster seems alright to me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855552:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855523
Thanks anon.
But that&amp;#x27;s a different anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855566:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855552
Fair I saw piss snake and just assumed. 

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855499
Long post not piss snake anon seems alright to me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855620:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like to see btc and eth dumping while xrp climbs up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855621:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855304
&amp;gt;1.34
beautiful number anon. I wouldn’t be surprised if it falls to 1.34 again. There definitely might be opportunities to make some money along the way considering it’s in a very volatile state right now. It’s undervalued but over volume. It could triple but it could just come straight back down again, possibly to a dime under a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855663:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855621
If they do drive it to under a dollar, I don&amp;#x27;t think they would do so anytime soon.
There isn&amp;#x27;t enough longs for them to profit much from that.
They&amp;#x27;d need to wait for new longs to be created, before such a move.
I&amp;#x27;ll periodically check on the XRP liquidation heatmap (and so should everyone else), to see if a significant concentration of longs get created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855681:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855663
A dollar, 1.30 or 1.50 even 2 dollars who the fuck cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855700:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855681
I finished packing my bag a long time ago.
However, I regret not selling $48k worth of XRP when we were over $3 last year per XRP.
Since I have no income right now (other than savings), I could have made that sale tax free since it&amp;#x27;s long term capital gains (over a year old).
I could have kept half and created a limit buy order for half my sell price with the other half.
And we&amp;#x27;ve easily gone down to $1.50 (half of $3), and then some.
$24k worth of pure tax free profit and I would have gotten back whatever XRP I sold when we dumped.
If I was wrong and it ended up never dropping to that level, it would have been fine, since that amount of XRP would have been only about 10% of my total bag.

I&amp;#x27;ve bagheld XRP too long, with an all or nothing approach.
As long as your bag is big enough, taking small percentages of profits makes sense to me.

&amp;gt;A dollar, 1.30 or 1.50 even 2 dollars who the fuck cares.
This part doesn&amp;#x27;t apply to me, but we have anons new to crypto or XRP that still have small bags; along with poor anons that can&amp;#x27;t afford to buy much.
It&amp;#x27;s relevant to them.
Buying at different prices makes a huge difference for them if they don&amp;#x27;t have much money to buy a lot of XRP and have only a small bag.
The cheaper they can buy XRP, the bigger their bag will be.

I never dollar cost averaged my buys, when I bought in 2021 and 2022.
I saved up money from my weekly paycheck and went months, and once over a year, in between my buys.
I didn&amp;#x27;t catch any of the bottoms on my buys, but I did fair much better than if I had dollar cost averaged on each paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855730:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exsqueeze me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855877:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855700
if you have +50k xrp then you should be on the top 1%, i think you will be fine if we do pump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855882:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855304
i mean, if you are poor it wouldnt be so bad to have 300k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855885:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61848187
congrats bro, hope to see you in the pleasure dome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855997:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855700
&amp;gt;I&amp;#x27;ve bagheld XRP too long, with an all or nothing approach.
I did similar, but, didn&amp;#x27;t anticipate it falling so hard. We still should see some good gains post Clarity Act, but I should have also cashed some out, at least to have more cash for a fall like we just had down to $1.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856003:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We just hit 10% up on the daily chart.
I&amp;#x27;m cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856004:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855877
&amp;gt;Tfw only a 1.063% holder according to the richlist
&amp;gt;tfw a 43.5k stacklet
Idk if I can catch up guys. Every purchase after $0.50 has been harder to climb the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856011:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856004
I only hold 200 xrp because im a poorfag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856016:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856004
Just gamble bro it makes inflating your stack ezpz all you have to do is win and not lose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856039:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856011
I&amp;#x27;m sorry fren. I should&amp;#x27;ve considered the pain of others when I spoke.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856016
Idk. I&amp;#x27;ve seen so many people in these threads swing and fail. I&amp;#x27;ve just been DCAing and once FXRP opened up on the Flare network I bridged and have been loaning it out on Kinetic making ~4% apy paid in FLR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856045:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856039
I mean you don&amp;#x27;t have to be a degenerate like me but you could go 2x or 3x easy and pretty much never get liquidated. I plan on just leveraging a 100k stack here soon at like 4x and just DCA and bring my leverage down over time with degenerate plays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856055:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856045
Do you also bet on prowrestling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856060:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEVER USE LEVERAGE

IT&amp;#x27;S A TRAP

THEY WANT YOU OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856064:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856055
No but I do some betting on kalshi from time to time for random shit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856067:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856060
That&amp;#x27;s why I am using leverage ... so i can get out ... I want out so I can move to japan and start my life and I have to use leverage since they won&amp;#x27;t just pump this shit to $10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856077:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;fascinating climb this coin is doing eh chaps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856088:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856004
i mean, you are right there, get a second job for a year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856186:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are we going up right now against the rest of the market? I&amp;#x27;m not used to good things happening for us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856205:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856077
Indubitably my good sir, I do say indeed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856246:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;redpill me on crossmark wallet
i hate phones, can crossmark be what xaman is just as a desktop browser extension rather than a phone app? can it connect to the xrp toolkit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856253:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856260:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should have bought way harder but honestly 500 bucks isn&amp;#x27;t bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856262:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856205
mmm splendid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856283:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sold 1/3 of my bag on $1.3 
am I cooked ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856309:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856283
what do we say about swingies, anon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856419:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this is a fever dream or have we gained back thread engagement without Spammy?

print fake receipts for selling metals

print fake receipts for alcohol

&amp;gt;why yes officer I drank all of the 300 bottles of whiskey at once and recycled them like a good american officer

&amp;gt;i promise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852598:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852208
Start feeding your parents omega3 supplements, megadoses of vitamin D, NAC, Alpha-GPC and lions mane. 

After a few months my mom went from halfway senile to being sharper than she was 25 years ago. Obviously talk to their doctor first to make sure none of these interact with any other medication they’re taking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852612:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
&amp;gt;gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852632:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
sell everything for either physical metals or real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852684:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Harvest losses and get paid for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852686:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Does this mean I can also claim unrealized losses? I can claim my house has dropped in value using any made up a reason: septic tank, termites, sea level rise, dark neighbors. That should more than cover any unrealized gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852700:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852686
You can do that only if you are still in debt for that house. But you aren&amp;#x27;t - so they&amp;#x27;ll just raise taxes. That&amp;#x27;s why you sell your real estate when a depression is on the horizon btw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852709:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
I cant do anything about it since I lost my keys. Maybe next time ill try to not be as clumbsy. Oh well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852737:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851633
&amp;gt;same price as 8 years ago
nice going, mr. cuckold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853093:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852029

I lived in aussie a year. I think you&amp;#x27;ll be alright. You&amp;#x27;re still very very far of us in term of fucking up. the mindset is very different. I found people were such bootlicking snitches but at the same time it makes a for a working society. I kinda envy you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853096:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853093
&amp;gt;I found people were such bootlicking snitches
absolutely. if the government banned all private ownership of gold we would dead set have couples dobbing each other into the police for not surrendering their wedding rings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853098:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
&amp;gt;unrealized

Literally buy a paining at a garage sale and a art appraiser says &amp;quot;That is worth a million dollars&amp;quot; and now you owe taxes on a million dollars.. but later you cannot find a buyer willing to spend a million on your painting because the artist is on the Epstein list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853099:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;skatteplanering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853104:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to reply to OP, being a fucking french, it could happen here if far left won. People are more economically retarded here also than anywhere else in the first world (and i&amp;#x27;m not entirely sure france is still a first world country)

I would either : fuck off somewhere else / give up on life and put everything in hard unseizable / untrackable assets and real estate IF real estate was spared of course.

This is very very bad. Most people aren&amp;#x27;t money minded like we are on biz but to me this law is like sovietisation. If it happens here i am 100% going to do something drastic about it, and in no way shape or form will i pay those new taxes. this is the hill i&amp;#x27;m willing to die on. for some people it&amp;#x27;s honor, love, familly. If you fuck with my money it&amp;#x27;s gonna end up very poorly for everyone, myself included possibly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853112:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853096

yes it was very irritating. Made me want to go back to my homecountry feeling so lonely with people like that.
But now i see things differently. At least things work. When someone do something wrong, you call the cops and they get fucked. Australian society &amp;gt; french society even tho you always feel like an outsider in australia and people are massive cunts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853118:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
I&amp;#x27;m a U.S. shitizen so I invest only in U.S. markets and brokerages anyway because everywhere else has worse laws and taxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853950:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Only reason I am still in my country is because of my family. But if not for them I’d move to Southeast Asia. So sick of being an incel loser here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853980:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Leave. At that point the alternative is hoping that it gets reversed otherwise you&amp;#x27;re stuck as a permanent underclass slave until you die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853984:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853950
why would being an incel loser in SEA be different?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854007:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853984
I am tall muscular and good looking and white so in sea I am automatically high status. I have to do nothing except exist, women just approach me and I just ask them if they want to hang out. It doesn’t matter how awkward I am or low status I am in the social context like in Canada.

In Canada hypergamy is too insane. You also have to be extremely extroverted, be a criminal like a drug dealer or part of a gang, have loads of friends and also fit a certain look/lifestyle so women will perceive you as high status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854015:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
How does this even work? You get fucked either way.

&amp;gt;hold on to your assets, get taxed for unrealized gains
&amp;gt;sell your assets to pay for unrealized gains, get taxed again for realized gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854230:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854015
it doesn&amp;#x27;t work. These kinds of policies have actually NEVER BEEN implemented fully like they are trying to do. it&amp;#x27;s not gonna work AT ALL.
I honestly have a hard time to believe they are going to implement this in 2028. The banks jews will seethe, the finance people will seethe, the whole NL stock market will seethe. 36% of profit realized is already pretty much outrageous you can&amp;#x27;t really go above that or you just kill the golden goose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854265:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Flee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854281:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
I&amp;#x27;ll be sitting smugly with my realized loss rebate check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854293:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
i spend my entire stack on whores, then rope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854299:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854281
&amp;gt;thinking they will refund losses
lol
lmao, even&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854315:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851570
You actually think the people building the digital prison state are just gonna leave the backdoor open? We’re fucked no matter what&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854324:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I live in Europe and feel the noose tightening. They really don&amp;#x27;t want members of the middle class being able to possibly become a counter-elite, and so we all have to get fucked. Have roughly 33% ea of my nw in house, tax deferred brokerage accts, and cold wallet and some phys g/s and 17th century coins. Currently working on building a portfolio of metamask accts with different growth strategies. One day I will leave for a better country and my nw will officially only be like $1m. My only worry is if something happens to me, will my family be able to figure out and access my metamask stuff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854331:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying to tax the dead people lmao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854441:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854324
take 2 safe in banks. split seed key in 2 with instructions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854479:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Move to Slovakia. Should probably do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854486:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Physical asset investment only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854878:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Finally outgrow this dumbass money moving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855575:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminder, real estate biz is exempt from the dutch law. This is cannibalizing everything to prop up real estate prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855604:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853104
They will put you in jail with all the Nafris and Africans. Best just to leave before it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855696:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
&amp;gt;Imagine that they pass unrealized tax gains in your country.
my country is already close to not paying taxes and that&amp;#x27;s the soft punishment for these fucking cunts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855709:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
The economy is currently designed to fuck me over &amp;amp; benefit the powerful.

You are worried about what; that it will be more designed to fuck me over? My brother in crimson we are already there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855772:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566

&amp;gt;tax unrealized gains on real estate
&amp;gt;half of people and business owners forced to sell their homes
renters will finally get a W&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855910:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851578
&amp;gt;bet $10k on red
&amp;gt;50/50 odds, so expected value is $10k
&amp;gt;get taxed on unrealized $10k gains 
&amp;gt;it&amp;#x27;s down to $7k
&amp;gt;win
&amp;gt;it&amp;#x27;s now $14k
&amp;gt;capital gains tax, -$4k
&amp;gt;back to $10k
you VILL own nothing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855929:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855910
what???&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855988:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Probably form a coalition to remove the Minecraft server admin and the moderators, permanently. I think enough players would be absolutely fucking sick of these shit fuck game mods that action would be required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856065:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855818
nope, real estate is exempt from the unrealized gains tax, so you don&amp;#x27;t even get affordable housing kek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856084:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854007
Kek delusional flikker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856095:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852029
&amp;gt;If they pass it in UK (which could be a possibility, since they&amp;#x27;re broke and ruined) they might attempt it here.
No, it&amp;#x27;s the other way around, faggot. Your shithole country already taxes pension contributions at 15% and taxed again at 15% if it&amp;#x27;s a TTR, two things that are absolutely unthinkable in the UK. Your financial sector is so underdeveloped you don&amp;#x27;t even have anything similar to an ISA and the only way to avoid CGT is to buy bonds and hold on to them for 10 years lmao. 
The UK has a million flaws but taxing wealth and investment isn&amp;#x27;t one of them. We get taxed on consumption but not even the most leftist government would think of taxing anything investment-related. 
Seriously, you can stop pretending you&amp;#x27;re ahead of us when it comes to personal liberties in any way. That mask slipped years ago during COVID when the world saw what a North Korea-tier shithole your country is. And it appears it&amp;#x27;s also a shithole in terms of economic liberties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856104:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
Sell everything and put it in monero and leave the country.
Anything I can&amp;#x27;t sell I burn to the ground.
Do as much sabotage as possible on my way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856531:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566
I&amp;#x27;m all in on Monero, I don&amp;#x27;t care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856538:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851566

&amp;gt;two more weeks until we’re all fucked (again)
&amp;gt;please keep the billions of dollars flowing because we can’t actually make a dime on our own without having to sell ads like the last company to tell you this same exact shit every 6 months for the last 3 years
&amp;gt;also pay no attention to the fact that that company, which was the forerunner and industry leader, and which was supposed to IPO at the end of last year is now going bankrupt and being cut loose by the entire sector (what’s that all about haha?)
&amp;gt;btw no we can’t even replace an Indian call center monkey yet with our trillion dollar human language model but, trust me, two more weeks and we won’t need doctors anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852468:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825
&amp;gt;i voted for this

Anyway, copilot is garbage. I use it only because work makes us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852494:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852432
&amp;gt;In 100 years
Try 10. Or even 5. Look back 5 years and see what AI was doing compared to now. Take that difference in scale and apply it to 2031. Even half that scale, or a quarter. AI CEOs, presidents, god emperor, overminds. You want it to happen 100 years from now so you can live the remainder of your life in some semblance of stability and normalcy but exponential curves don&amp;#x27;t care about what you want. You will experience profound discomfort daily in the face of unconstrained acceleration and there will be no opt-outs short of a bullet to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852497:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852432
not true. CEOs, managers, accountants, etc. are jobs that will always require people for the sole purpose of accountability. there needs to be someone to fire, someone to take the blame when something goes wrong. companies will always need someone to take the fall in these positions, but everything else will be ai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852514:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852468
&amp;gt;have copilot “training” in March
&amp;gt;use ChatGPT to automate every part of my job
&amp;gt;copilot is basically 4o in capabilities
It’ll take them another 3-4 years to replace me. These people are clueless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852519:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852497
Shareholders decide who is in charge. And society will decide who governs them. Our overlords will be AI in the end. This is the next revolution. Police brutality will end. Famine will end. War will end. Class struggles will end. But at the cost of true freedom. Every single job and task will be automated away. Humans will eventually become extinct or locked in a cage like zoo animals for test experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852531:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852497
Nonsense. Everyone up to my CEO can be replaced. The President of our country can be replaced. It’s all about what we’re willing to accept. It’s all one big joke. I’d rather be cut a UBI check for a fraction of my salary with deflated prices of goods and services than pretend any of this means anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852547:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852519
Someone who gets it. Next comes the infinite orgy. But what comes after the orgy? We’re just becoming increasingly efficient with the end of meaning and purpose. This is it. Strap in, head into the digital substrate. See you in infinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852553:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825
TRVKE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852694:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850151
By investing in data centers which are more expensive, brilliant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852706:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact you will be able to make porn of literally whatever you wish at a whim justifies any investment into AI

The demand for that will be literally infinite

Also it will annihilate the Jewish ran porn industry which is GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852710:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850482
Lmao NO

AI is great of you want to look something up on stack overflow though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852715:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Once the government bails us out wagies are FINISHED!

good thing we live in a democracy run by the people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852723:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850763
I asked an ai about something in Kerbal space program today and it spat out what was effectively nonsense but would sound good to someone with no knowledge on the subject.
No imagine trusting that shit for tax or legal advice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852835:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852723
I have the paid version of ChatGPT and it gives solid financial advice. But if you’re seeking alpha, it’ll go “Uhh here you go” and spout Mag 7 stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852850:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849854
This isn&amp;#x27;t actually about investment or profits
The techbros behind this have bought into the idea of Rokos Basilisk and are desperately shoveling in as much money as they can to appease their hypothetical future machine God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852886:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825

CEOs are already ultra-useless and unproductive. when do they go? AI would know how to make best use of the workers.

There isn&amp;#x27;t thought that &amp;quot;AI CEO&amp;quot; has that ChatGPT couldn&amp;#x27;t explain and act on better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852891:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;every non-brahmin will be unemployed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852928:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850900

my company is going the other way. dumping offshore tech workers like crazy and asking US employees to spend more time doing actual productive things vs. trying to coordinate and manage less productive offshore teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853174:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825

Microsoft is literally so Indian-occupied that the management implemented India&amp;#x27;s caste system and said Dalit must do the C++ work because Python is easier and thus only high castes get the easy jobs. They even got sued for this lmao
It&amp;#x27;s genuinely over for them as a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854047:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849863

Yes, wanna fight about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854296:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It fails the logic test. If AI was so good this would have already happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854303:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825
What never makes sense to me is why these companies just bag the profits made from using ai instead paying workers? Why not expand (which would create new jobs to replace the old) and make your company even bigger and better? 

There are numerous examples of how they could grow the company with the money. Microsoft here could now go into robotics and work on the first fully functional sexbot. Or they could go into that Internet cafe shit that&amp;#x27;s popular in Japan and open them here in the US. The possibilities are endless when you now have tens of millions in disposable income as a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854312:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854303
Once a company goes public it basically can&amp;#x27;t do anything that doesn&amp;#x27;t deliver immediate profits for the shareholders. And once it gets to the size of microsoft it can&amp;#x27;t innovate anymore because every single decision has to go through teams upon teams of people. It&amp;#x27;s the same reason why all democracies are imploding right now, the system cannot come to a consensus on anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854316:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;NOOO BASTERD! YOU CANNOT MAKE LIVING WITHOUT COMPANY SAAR LISTEN TU MEEE I AM CEO!

Anon, the main concern everyone has is what will they do to put food on the table when they get displaced. Everyone is struggling and the dream of owning a home has dissipated.

But yeah, I am indeed looking forward to not having to hire someone to do something AI can do for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854384:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850884
Anon, this is a solved problem. AI are essentially overly confident humans with limited memory. So you give them tools (i.e. the ability to call a price API or search on the internet) so they don&amp;#x27;t go based on their model training and merely just reason their way with new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854389:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850522
denial is the most predictable of all human responses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854456:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854368

The problem is that there&amp;#x27;s no plan in place to protect you from AI job loss and government is slow and inefficient at implementing anything, if they ever do at all. We aren&amp;#x27;t going to see UBI until well after people are destitute, and that&amp;#x27;s if UBI is even something they implement.

I wouldn&amp;#x27;t be surprised if people don&amp;#x27;t even care, or darker, say they deserved to lose their jobs and take glee and delight at seeing it happen. I already see it on social media all the time. It&amp;#x27;s even in this thread. &amp;quot;They had do-nothing jobs where they just sat in a chair all day staring at a screen, fuck &amp;#x27;em!&amp;quot; 

No one is saving you. Prepare to take a low-skill physical labor job if you aren&amp;#x27;t proficient in a skilled trade, which you likely aren&amp;#x27;t. Same as most white-collar workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855862:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825

Here is an extreme scenario: AI+robotics achieve human level thinking and movement, and it is cheaper to manufacture and maintain one compared to owning a literal human slave. If such robots are privately owned, the corporations could develop an independent self sustaining economy. The corporation won&amp;#x27;t even need to think about money at this point. They won&amp;#x27;t have to think about 99% of people who don&amp;#x27;t participate in this robot economy.
More &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; (not really) scenario: office jobs are eliminated. Everyone is pushed into blue collar jobs, and white collar jobs that need human presence legally. Corporations save tons of money on salaries and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855870:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825

This makes sense though, financial advice is the type of thing which can be standardized to result in a decent enough result. Diversification, staying with reliabl dividend payers who regular post increasing earnings. The question of how to be an &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; investor has been solved and the AI is smart enough to scour the internet to regurgitate it to you. If a question hasn&amp;#x27;t been solved there is nothing for the AI to give you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856504:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849825
Even if AI can replace all jobs that doesn&amp;#x27;t guarantee that AI itself will be profitable. If AI can make AI there is no reason to use any particular AI, so why would anyone pay for AI?

Servers, electricity, water, real estate, etc these things will be needed to be rented to make AIs run of course, so the money will be in these things, not the producers of AI&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771002740425739s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>The EU is going full degen — 39 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856214</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61856214</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 07:38:08 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The EU is going full degen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replies: 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OP:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856217:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214

These are late stage failed society policies.
Unrealised capital gains taxes and raiding savings accounts to fund &amp;quot;investments&amp;quot; that are so shit they can&amp;#x27;t justify private investments is mafia tier.

Europoor is going to take on a new meaning soon when all the non wage slave Europeans leave to avoid getting financially raped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856284:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856263

No, the money is going to existing retirees. There won&amp;#x27;t be any left for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856308:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856223

The longer it goes on, the worse it gets for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856363:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856214
Yes — the statement is essentially real, and it comes from an actual European Union initiative, but it’s important to understand it correctly.

 Real context:
The European Commission, under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen, is preparing the Savings and Investments Union (SIU). Its goal is to better connect citizens’ savings with investments within the EU. This is part of a broader effort to strengthen Europe’s capital markets and competitiveness by improving how savings flow into productive investments.

 The statement shown in the image (“We’ll turn private savings into much needed investment.”) was posted as a tweet and it does exist. It circulated widely online and sparked public debate.

 Important clarification:
This statement does not mean that the EU will seize people’s savings or take money from private bank accounts against their will. The initiative aims to create better conditions and incentives so that citizens who choose to do so can invest their savings more easily through European capital markets. There is no automatic or forced transfer of personal savings.

 So, to answer your question:
Yes — the quote is based on a real tweet and a real EU policy initiative. It was not fabricated, but it has often been shared without proper context, which can lead to misleading interpretations.

If you want, I can also explain what the Savings and Investments Union would mean in practice and what concrete measures are being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856386:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856360
Then tell your russian oligarch president to go home, moron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856389:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856363
Oh no really, another vatnigger talkingpoint is turning out to be a complete lie. The german retirement ponzi is coming to an end and europe needs to go the way like the anglo centric world creating retirement through the stock market. Just 15% of germans have an investment account at all. The EU is going full imoerialist and soon vatniggers will clean our shitters for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856392:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856389

I really hope we get the euro equivalent of a 401k soon.
An unbureaucratic euro Inc. for startups such that they don&amp;#x27;t have to register in multiple countries would be nice.
The we need a European stockmarket to avoid fractionalised liquidity.
That will pull massive private investment. Germany also has so many good companies you can&amp;#x27;t invest in because they are private. Maybe that could also inncentivise more ipos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856420:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856409

Some people even managed to interview Gary Gensler and have dedicated their full time and effort towards this noble endeavor. These same people support gme though and say they trust Ryan Cohen, except half of Ryan cohens short busting activities over the last 3 years which have heavily revolved around bbbyq, they ban and censor that talk as clearly nonsense but RCs other short busting activities are ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61849280:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61849114

shills are now faking videos to do damage control lmao. if you go to the whisper moment in the recording, Jake&amp;#x27;s mic is clearly muted. this means that this shill took a recording from some other moment and overlayed it with the whisper audio...the absolute state of their desperation kek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61850288:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850251
The shills are so assblasted about BBBY. The level of seething is unfathomable if they were not paid shills. 
&amp;gt;Maybe the whispering came from Jake!
What a silly and petty thing to be wasting your time over. No one talks about AMSNEED because there is no purpose. No one is talking and no one is listening. The attention surrounding BBBY proves this is a something-burger. We knew this even before we saw the CUSIP Confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851259:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850288
I&amp;#x27;m thinking BBBY-WT is the deep value investment right now and all they can do is seethe while they give out cheapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851791:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851259
Yea ive been slurping. Same Cusip. Makes sense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851890:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr jaques put on the latex gloves and went elbow deep into attoshit. Hilarious. Saw someone on x was chillfagging from etrade today re the warrants? Stinky. Also what&amp;#x27;s this about you cant exercise the bobby warrants? which have a similiar cusip to the old yq ticker? That is currently mia? Yet you can drs the gme warrants which afaik doesnt have the same cusip conundrum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61851893:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851890
*exercise the gme warrants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852001:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;everybody is Keith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852014:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851259
Exactly. 
Remember what the shorts have revealed about naked shorting. It is a psychological assault to get longs to sell and walk away because the shorts are manhandling the price to be boring. But the more important aspect of this is that in order for their mind-games to be credible, they do have to misprice the assets. Once you know the gameplan you can comfortably stop paying attention to the price action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852344:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851259
Pumping and dumping the BBBY warrants using the BBBYQ delusions is not going to end well for you. Despite the CUSIP-6 matching, these are not related at all as confirmed by the issuer of the warrants. BBBYQ canceled shareholders never received any warrants because you can&amp;#x27;t issue warrants for a stock that doesn&amp;#x27;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852461:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852344
&amp;gt;Despite the CUSIP-6 matching, these are not related at all
Jesus. Fucking Kek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852611:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851890
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851893
Post link, dunno who the fuck dr Jacques is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852616:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852344
&amp;gt;these are not related at all as confirmed by the issuer of the warrants.

Lemonis can’t confirm any such thing as cusip-6 reuse (same organizational id) and cusip assignment is not up to the companies whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852652:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852461
Kek indeed, the CUSIP-6 matching and you still never getting anything for your canceled shares is the best part of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852690:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852344
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852652&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852701:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852690
Yes I do. BBBYQ canceled shareholders are completely wiped out and will NEVER get anything for canceled shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61852941:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852701
Can’t say never yet until the chapter 11 has fully concluded, as the judge himself stated it is completely possible and legal for previous shareholders to receive new shares and or cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853279:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852941
you lost tranny, stop the cope. you lost your money by investing a random about to bankrupt company. it&amp;#x27;s over. time to rope. you can start 1000000000 threads in /biz/, will not change the FACT that: THEY&amp;#x27;LL NEVER PAY YOU ANYTHING, YOU LOST YOUR MONEY LIKE A RETARD, NOW YOU ARE IN FULL COPE MODE, but it&amp;#x27;s over. you are a retard. You could just buy some good ETF. VCs fooled you, like an idiot savant, they took your money and throw you out to the street. Keep opening this threads for me to get a nice KEK from your cope.

YOU (RETARD) BOUGHT MEME STOCKS OF &amp;quot;ABOUT TO BANKRUPT&amp;quot; COMPANY
COMPANY BANKRUPTS
SOMEONE ELSE CAME AND BOUGHT THE NAMES AND STUFF FOR THEIR DEBT
THEY STARTED SAME COMPANY WITH SAME NAME AND ASSIP6
NOW YOU OWN NOTHING

just kek baggie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853283:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853279
they are not gonna pay anything to you and I hope they hold you personally resposible for unpaid depts, since as a stockholder you were partner of the company, you knew they have debts, you bought the stock anyway, so you are responsible, time to pay more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853404:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853279

I don&amp;#x27;t care about any of it since I buy real stocks, not meme ones. You gambled and you lost. COPING, SEETHING and DILATING here is not going to change the FACT that: &amp;quot;YOU LOST YOUR MONEY LIKE AN IDIOT SAVANT, YOU&amp;#x27;LL NEVER GET IT BACK&amp;quot;. I&amp;#x27;m talking with facts. You are talking with COPE. Instead of spamming biz with these retardic threads, you should go and get some therapy. Also hey don&amp;#x27;t shoot the messenger, i&amp;#x27;m just relaying you information about REALITY. Yes I&amp;#x27;m the messenger of REALITY. You&amp;#x27;ve been living in a dream world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853536:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nuh uh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853587:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;You loss all? I REALLY care about it for some reason!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853613:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This better be one of you larping. Kek. If it’s not I haven’t seen seething like this in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853632:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853518

Is it still true that Marcus lemonois doesn’t get paid if bbby doesn’t rise a lot this month? 

I remember he had a change of job title recently. Idk if that means a different pay structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854525:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854282
FY 2026 proposed pay structure pending approval at next shareholder meeting:
https://www.ainvest.com/news/bed-bath-shares-surge-5-55-pre-market-ceo-compensation-package-disclosure-2601/
&amp;gt;$300k salary
&amp;gt;Up to $2.2 million bonus cash based on performance
&amp;gt;Up to 2.1 million shares and RSU
This does not spark joy. 

FY 2025 pay structure:
&amp;gt;3/28/2025 DEF 14A
https://investors.beyond.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx
$0 salary
$0 cash bonus
424,300 shares (this does not spark joy) 
2.25 million shares in call options at $45, $50, $60 tranches with a 4.98% increase in share price the day following disclosure of MNPI

I don&amp;#x27;t see anything about the vesting period for the call options expiring after 2 years specifically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854548:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852611
jake2b&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854641:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s amazing how how Clarifying the Cusip Conunudrum is. Concern trolls want to Crypost but their caustic concerns completely crumble by the confirmation of the CUSIP Confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854722:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854641
there is also a conundrum concerning a certain creditor to the company :o)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854941:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854722
Checked. Who could it be? What does it all mean?!?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855003:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont care.
I dont cafè&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855287:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003
This goes to show you just how dumb and disingenuous the silly shillies are. You can ask Goldberg whatever the hell you want but he is not obligated to give you a truthful answer when M&amp;amp;A is involved. He wouldn&amp;#x27;t tell you so this is completely useless. 
This still does not solve the CUSIP Conundrum. Words only get you so far, but right here right now in 2026 there are open Bed Bath and Beyond stores and the company that operates them is not even using the Overstock/BYON/BBBY CUSIP. They issued new securities in October using BBBYQs CUSIP. 
It&amp;#x27;s already proven 100% fact that a reverse merger of the BBBYQ shell has already occurred with BBBY. There is zero counterargument. 
Overstock, BYON and BBBY all kept them same CUSIP. So why now does it suddenly switch? Occams Razor solves the puzzle: BBBYQ shell reverse merger has already occured and the details are not in any known docket.
BBBY mystery has been solved by yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855551:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003
Mayhaps DK-Butterfly and DK-Butterfly1 are different entities. As per the Jake DD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855610:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855551
It&amp;#x27;s just a typo, bro. For some reason, when writing out DK-Butterfly. I, too, will accidentally add on a -1 for no reason. This speculative theories are bizarre-1. See! Haha, I did it on accident just now. I can&amp;#x27;t even believe I did that LOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855697:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855003

i have 70 shares in CS 10 in fidelity and 10 warrants. am i gm?pls no bully. i had 300 shares at one point but what they don’t tell you about depression is that it’s very expensive. i’m working my ass off to buy more shares before shit blows up but i’m also trying not to end up homeless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855166:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854860
They are sliding fierce. 
Anyways this was a test run. Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855190:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855141
my method is simply to buy as many shares as i can and not worry about it

i used to be stack-conscious too but then i just kept telling myself the more i buy the better

and then sldo in the mean time you can come here and partake in calling the &amp;quot;you can&amp;#x27;t ryan&amp;quot; posters faggots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855191:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855141
Dep a thickle bitch.
At 200 or 2k you at 16, 160k broski. Saw a logarithmic chart that had a proportional 12,000% window as in 2020-21, so 24k a share if that repeats. How does 1.6mil sound?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855242:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855141
Look at this picture my brother. Burn it into your mind. I&amp;#x27;m either going to become a multi-millionaire or blow my head off. No in between. Quite literally my entire life is in this one trade. I&amp;#x27;m not selling for anything less than $1 mill a share. $1 mill a share or death. It is what it is.

Or… 100 shares at $60k/share post tax is ~$3m, so I’m gonna hodl for that so they can make it too. If any anons say I’m price anchoring, then they agmi too because anything under $10m/share post yid keyboard fuckup is the standard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855318:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855242
“It’s just a glitch.” D butthole lauer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855323:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stacklets, and those who plan to sell GME in general upon MOASS, need to burn this into their mind as well. Oh, the system will grant you all the Federal Reserve debt notes your heart desires!

Gold and silver are money. Divest from GME with great caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855326:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855310

Youre in that 4chan monger telegram group arent you

I don&amp;#x27;t know what to make of this. The post and all of OP&amp;#x27;s comments are clearly written by AI. But it seems compelling. But this isn&amp;#x27;t the first time clearly AI DD promised a groundbreaking insight that ended up not meaning anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855534:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854591
&amp;gt;Is there really a doubt that a “meme stock” has been deemed a new type of security with different rules and exceptions?

post a link to this new regulatory framework. They can delay as long as the derivatives market allows hiding short interest (bill hwang did this) and hiding positions inside swaps and other bespoke instruments. BBBY owns tzero, nothing happens without M&amp;amp;A activity, guess which companies will be involved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855545:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ken Griffin is having a bad week. Let us take a moment of silence for ken Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855615:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855141
1 share in CS:GO = 1 wagmi

x+1 share in CS:GO = 1 wagmi 

The bigger x is, the faster 1 wagmi happens

I would like to test being rich now. That would help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855647:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855615
I would also argue
1 warrant = 1 wagmi - $32
1 share in broker = $250k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855653:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;*all shares in broker = $250k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855670:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854868
At that price even selling half my shares I qualify for that 30 day &amp;quot;please let me sell&amp;quot; bullshit that anon was talking about. Is it really in our prophecy that moass happens because anons can&amp;#x27;t fucking sell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855745:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854860

It would explain why everyone who mentions buying LEAPS gets dogpiled by screeching retards even though DFV&amp;#x27;s whole strategy was LEAPS+shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855774:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855769

I would sooner buy long dated puts on spy than options on gme. Just buying shares and warrants seems smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855792:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855783
Not to mention that in a situation where GME&amp;#x27;s share count is fully reconciled, the options chain will not be a safe haven. Force majeure cash settlement inbound for the optionfags while DRS chads rest easy as gazillionaires.
&amp;gt;Sorry goy, an Act of God happened! Here&amp;#x27;s some cash! Sorry about your GME options contract!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855824:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;QED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855852:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854610

this sentence is to shills what the garlic is to vampires.
it&amp;#x27;s 100% obvious that gamestop is NOT a &amp;quot;memestock&amp;quot; (made up fake label anyways) but a normal stock traded on the stock market and all indicators and fundamentals point towards a bullish outlook. that&amp;#x27;s factual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855879:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any Dutch bros here?

Technically volatility halts could keep the markets in this autonomous glacier where it becomes very hard to clear/confirm trades: https://www.luldplan.com/

Here&amp;#x27;s the NYSE halts that get updated during regular hours: https://www.nyse.com/trade/trading-information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856112:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burry is reposting his sneeze summary.

I feel like they&amp;#x27;d make an emergency exception of some kind. The worst thing they could possibly do is forcibly diamond hand everyone for a month straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856300:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856282
Right at that point I&amp;#x27;d be cutting just-below-threshold deals for securities backed loans and then just not paying them back. Tax free windfall, plowed straight into assets of my choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856331:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;55 trillion market cap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856346:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855460

Yes, and I didn&amp;#x27;t mean the price of a coin, but the marketcap of the network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855156:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854923
It still is. They need to liquidate the last of the leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855301:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoom out and look at the chart. It&amp;#x27;s still going down.

lets not forget the amount of money required to mine btc is around 90k&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855565:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854923

&amp;gt; bitcoin is a scam
&amp;gt; shows up in every bitcoin thread
&amp;gt; low IQ
&amp;gt; watches the bitcoin price chart closer than most bitcoiners

Why are gold and silver bag holders like this?

I never go into gold or silver threads, unless I just want to look at the stacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855685:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854923
Brother this weak sauce pump is just another bull trap to get more liquidity before the next leg down. This is your last chance to SELL if you are still holding any bags

An actual reversal would have had a shit ton more momentum. We ARE going to 50K, you could literally see it etched into picrelated&amp;#x27;s face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855694:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;like buffet said its a turd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855705:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854923

I don&amp;#x27;t though. It&amp;#x27;s readily visible in your 30 threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855894:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854966

&amp;gt;tax
Lmao. When this law was first discussed a while back on R*ddit some cuck got extremely upset when I said I will simply not pay an unlawful tax and that&amp;#x27;s that.
&amp;gt;But you HAVE to pay the tax anon! Strong shoulders should carry heavy burdens! 
I already pay more taxes than all of these retards will ever do and I am sure as hell not going to pay even more. If our government wants to find out first hand whether the Laffer curve holds up in real life that&amp;#x27;s fine with me, I&amp;#x27;ll immediately prove it by not declaring my gains anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855031:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854861
&amp;gt;no real rich in NL
Nigger, what?
That&amp;#x27;s where the olde tyme vampire clan shit money is. Millenium old money. They aren&amp;#x27;t in the crosshairs of this legislation, but you&amp;#x27;re lying to yourself about the wealth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855051:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how do they assess the &amp;quot;unrealized gain?&amp;quot;
Let me guess they just tack it to the market peak for that fiscal year? Lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855052:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855051
All you have to do is sell the absolute tippy top every time, bro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855065:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854733
That&amp;#x27;s a your problem bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855066:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;i am getting really tired. first i was replaced in my own country, then i became chronically ill but couldnt get gibs while achmed takes everything. Then I go -80% in crypto only to escape break-even. Now I&amp;#x27;m down -3% on my shit stocks portfolio. i shorted the most bullish altcoin that has ever existed because mossad pumps it, roughly one in a million chance, and am $200 underwater when I was $6k in profits just a week ago. Now I cant have income, am forced to be an investor, praying that I will have money in 10, 20 years. I doomscroll twitter and EVERY post is shitting on my country for being retarded. I plan to leave, but my parents are eternal boomers who literally live forever and survive everything that should kill them. By the time thye die and I get my pittance, a house, I will be forced to sell it. By then it will have lost 40% of its current value, inheritance tax will be higher, I will be taxed 36% on any gains I&amp;#x27;ve had, and I will be forced to pay 5 years of exit tax because....well just because goy. this is how habeebers are created. jesus,save me, i have no recourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855074:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;and nobody here plays minecraft its always admin funded accounts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855082:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855031
They moved to belgium and america.
Millionaire stastics are per household btw so actual rich people are almost not a thing since any income above 70k or so is taxed 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855083:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;its nothing but this shit on twitter. nothing but posts reminding me about my country rugpulling me. endless demoralization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855086:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;a once nice country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855088:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;bbc 47, for everyone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855104:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854817
kek polchuds seetheeing harder than trannies these days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855105:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s quite something to just sit back in your chair and ponder the sheer jewishness of the phrase &amp;quot;unrealized gain&amp;quot; for a few minutes, you can really get lost in thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855106:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855083
Well I&amp;#x27;m sorry anon but if you live there then it&amp;#x27;s really fucked up what can I tell you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855109:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854715
White peoples money MUST go to Muslims. You wouldn’t want to be racist right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855120:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854759
Also this. How do I short the Dutch economy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855160:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854726
I&amp;#x27;m not so sure anymore. The cat came out of the bag with the Epstein emails. Those hellbent on destroying the western world don&amp;#x27;t need to pretend to care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855174:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855160
there is nothing so horrible that our politicans wouldnt inflict it on us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855187:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854759
Foreigners don&amp;#x27;t get taxed on unrealised gains on Dutch stocks tho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855196:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855106
Im almost 40 kek 4 decades of rugpull after rugpull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855199:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855160
no the difference is that the american public cares about the market

Dutch retards only care about real estate which they can barely achieve, and putting their money on a savings account that gets outpaced by inflation

the result is that only 15-20% of the population know what box 3 is

Thats why its so hard to protest it and why its not on the news. even if they put it on the news, 80% of niggercattle does not understand it. we are totally relying on the 0.01% here to get pissed off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855207:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855199
&amp;gt;no the difference is that the american public cares about the market
Lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855216:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855066
All I can tell you is a whole fuckton lot of you Dutchbros are going to have to get mad, real mad, and start organizing some serious protests. Raise enough hell, have wnough money expatriate and theyll back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855223:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855207
 in usa the market is the economy, here the market is for gamblers/1337 professionals/etc. 

equity ownership in the netherlands is high actually but they have no idea how it works (pension funds), as a result of the education system + genetic stupidity/naivety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855235:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855216
indeed but 80% went along with covid, and you know what being in the &amp;lt;20% is like. only 15% buy equity here. that&amp;#x27;s why the only possible protest can come from a bunch of 0.01%&amp;#x27;ers. but they dont care because they can afford to buy ways out of the system. thats a flat rate, not a %. ie. spending 20k eur for an offshore setup is a nobrainer for them but not feasible for normal people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855240:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;anyway we can mail eerstekamer faggots, politely and nicely, they probably never get contacted unlike 2eK turbofags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855253:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855216
Aren&amp;#x27;t the dutch the most cucked people? Seems like half the dutch girls are with nafris or blacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855264:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855253
the germanic weakness to state propaganda combines with fascination with and fetishization of tribal cultures to create an abominable race&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855270:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854715
how does a society fall so fast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855272:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We got jewed in the &amp;#x27;golden age&amp;#x27; because of cheap labor and since then the coffers have been bleeding dry. the king is a traitor. some people love to grandstand about piet hein and muh VOC...... enjoy the past while you suffer at present&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855702:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goes into effect in 2028, other first world nations will push to do the same around then. 

The clock is officially ticking now. Only a few years left to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856226:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854715
guys do you think there will be economic sanctions on the Netherlands?
i can&amp;#x27;t believe the rest of the world will just sit by when one country completely nukes their stock market. since the whole economy is connected, i could imagine the USA or other countries having a thing or two to say about this bs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856232:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854767
Amsterdam Exchange.
They have some big companies like Shell where boomers probably have a lot cash of parked since they dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856233:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856226
someone has to be first anon. governments around the world are licking their lips with glee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856259:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;long weed, pharmaceutical and funeral stuff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856275:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856226
Why would they? They need to forcibly transfer all the speculative money into real estate. Boomers won&amp;#x27;t say no to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856280:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peasants and serfs don&amp;#x27;t need to own/profit off investments, just put it in your ecb backed bank account and pay your taxes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856292:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855199
40% of population in netherlands are niggers and arabs. In few decades they will be 80%. Economy route they are taking is completely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856293:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855207
They do care bro, people in the USA got their 401k, there&amp;#x27;s non of that here, here people rely 100% on the gob for their retirement. If you don&amp;#x27;t live in europe you have no idea how retarded the niggercattle locals are here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856301:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the last thread:

&amp;gt;make a shitcoin with an absurdly high number of coins, all minted at the start
&amp;gt;before the first record date sell one to an anonymous alt account for 1 EUR
&amp;gt;Belastingdienst now thinks you ar ethe richest man on earth
&amp;gt;between the first and second record date sell another coin for 0,01 EUR
&amp;gt;your quadrillions of paper losses now count against the gains in your portfolio
&amp;gt;0% tax for a year and get the hell out to the Antilles
(or sell another coin after the second record date for 1 EUR and watch the government try to press more taxes out of you that exist in the entire world economy for the lolz)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856303:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monero solves this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856306:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854833
Are you implying the markets are somehow manipulated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856310:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856293
used to live there, arabs are the worth, the destruction was planned long ago, slowly for surely invading the more civilized world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856321:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856301
Kek. Would this work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856322:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854715
&amp;gt;getting taxed on money that doesn&amp;#x27;t exist yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856326:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854817
They&amp;#x27;re dopamine fiends with actual ass parasites burrowing into their spinal cord causing them to act this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856343:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856310
Yeah the USA posters don&amp;#x27;t know how good they have it. And I&amp;#x27;ve seen some threads encouraging people to take their money out of USA assets.. JUST FUCKING LOL. Trust me STAY OUT OF EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856505:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854715

Mostly on the 70side of things? Seems like it&amp;#x27;s been stuck around there for awhile now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855389:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#x27;s been 2 weeks since is was 120. Nothing is settled. This is cheapies time for the cryptoniggers, but looks like they would rather continue to play with digital fiat instead of stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855399:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855373
$300 by summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855411:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855373
it&amp;#x27;s going down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855420:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855411
It&amp;#x27;s been bouncing around mid 70s to mid 80s for awhile now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855424:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855389

Good. I hope they all go broke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855428:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855399

Shut the fuck up you stupid rock hoarder you stupid fucks will wish you got into xrp sub 1000 dollars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855436:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855430

XRP will be lucky to get to $10 let alone $1000. It’s a glorified memecoin on a ghostchain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855494:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope it goes down to $20 to $30. I&amp;#x27;ll buy more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855525:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855494
I wouldn&amp;#x27;t mind that also wouldn&amp;#x27;t mind it skyrocketing either way it&amp;#x27;s a win for me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855532:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855389
&amp;gt;play with digital fiat instead of stack.
I&amp;#x27;m more tempted to buy into something like PSLV. Physical stacking I don&amp;#x27;t like the security concern. I don&amp;#x27;t have a safe or anything. Plus you have physical premiums too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855572:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855532
&amp;gt;i would rather buy into paper market that is fractionally reserved just like fiat
Yes. As I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855573:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855532
&amp;gt;I don&amp;#x27;t have a safe or anythin
Why do you worry over that? Are you a drug addict who hangs out with other drug addicts or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855756:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855430

Poo in the loo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855864:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855453

Fuck you silver shills the only people who make fun of Indians are other Indians there is only Indians who collect silver and gold obviously you are projecting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856520:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855373
You are going to be wrong on both ends.
It is going to fall below this floor range during Chinese New Year and demand falls.
It is going to rise back above the range ceiling when they open back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856533:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855532
&amp;gt;I have security concerns over holding physical silver
&amp;gt;having someone else manage my digital fiat is much better
That’s retarded, anon. Silver is at $77/oz right now. Do you live in a house that has things worth more than $77?

I don&amp;#x27;t want to pay higher taxes so lazy socialist losers can get UBI though. If politicians want to help people have more money, just reduce the income tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853627:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852893
Like what? There has been no advances in AI theory in literally decades. LLMs themselves are not even a new idea or breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853647:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850597
Pretend you are running a civilization. You only have so many subjects that qualify as excellent scientists and leaders. You need to pivot this human capital from making pizza commercials and balding cream to something more important (maybe). How do you do this?

You take away the spending power of the dirt bike salesmen. You stock Walmart with endless toys made out of plastic and silicon that have a higher IQ than their owners. And plenty of delicious foods (90% onions/corn derivatives by calories). 

Walmart and amazon accept the CBDC UBI as long as your digital ID&amp;#x27;s vaccination log is fully complete

If you end up in that pit its GG. You aren&amp;#x27;t getting out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853662:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850756
&amp;gt;you get freedom as long as you follow the rules 
It was a good idea before women could vote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853757:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850978
One stat that i always find interesting is that 70% of people enter the top 20%. Obviously they dont stay there and they fuck up and lose their money.

Maybe AI robots will be the new consumers. They work and paid via subscription payments (income) they spend this on energy, maintenance, upgrades. Essentially slaves that corps will own to rent out and sell to each other. We will long for the day immigrants drove down wages. The &amp;quot;economy&amp;quot; will become so abstract and owners will be so insulated there will be effectively 2 different worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853777:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850994
&amp;gt;It&amp;#x27;s mostly latinos. Millenials are not represented in construction. But I&amp;#x27;m seeing more white zoomeds as they realize college is a scam and trades have potential for real wealth

Are you retarded or just gay? If &amp;quot;latinos&amp;quot; spanish speaking non citizens driving down price of labor plus more citizens going into trades as you say. Increase supply of labor reduces demand. Thus reducing wages further. Why do people who know nothing seem to think they know and proceed to tell everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853796:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853647
what happened to horses when the automotive became mass produced and affordable? were horses allowed to live out the rest of their days in comfort at the expense of generous land owners or taxpayers -- or were they sent off to the glue factory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853799:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61852219
Physical value? So like farming? That shit went from most of us to 1% . Same with industrial products like steel production. Use to require many more smaller plants until they built giant ones of economic scale. The number of people it took to run 3 now run 1 and make more steel. That can be applied to almost every physical product and why &amp;quot;luxury&amp;quot; items are cheaper. The only real constraint is energy. 

&amp;gt;.t i watch a lot of modern marvels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853835:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853799
desu it&amp;#x27;s hard to get an accurate view of the value of farming because it&amp;#x27;s highly manipulated. you have state and local governments giving out preferential tax treatments to farmlands, the federal government giving out subsidies for certain crops (sometimes to grow crops, sometimes not to grow crops), and then there are literally millions and millions brown spicnigger laborers who do the jobs that mechanical devices can&amp;#x27;t do. 

some of these spicniggers are legal on H2A visas that exist to legally pay shitskins pseudo slave wages (like $15/hour) and then you have countless illegal spicniggers without a visa.

the whole capitalist mantra of &amp;quot;more value = more money&amp;quot; thing is a load of nonsense because we practice a bastardized form of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61853928:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853835
&amp;gt;value of
Wut? Who cares about value. We went from 50% doing it to 1%. Full stop. Legal or not (slavery was) the math is the same and affects of supply and demand. The best periods of history were under monarchy rule, in a ethnic and culturally homogeneous people. There will always be people better than others. The top 20% is burdened with leading the flock or will be cast back into stone age by the bottom 80%. This is a law of nature, the law of 80/20 in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854008:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61853796

Yeah, white zoomer in construction here. Here&amp;#x27;s the caveat: I work for my daddy in his construction company. Guys like me are the only ones who are in construction. I had a whole band of friends back in high school who would have made great blue collar types 40 years ago turn to meth and other hard drugs and kill themselves over the years due to having no future. I was the only one who went to college (daddy made me) and I dropped out to work for him after a couple years. I made $32 an hour which is poor in the grand scheme of things but rich for a zoomer. I put in my hard work with my dad&amp;#x27;s other laborers. 

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850896
I agree with your idea that being a builder is the way to go. Even my boomer parents are aware that working is a scam and the only people who make real money anymore are the ones who already have assets (like my dad) literally every day I thank god I was born as his son. I&amp;#x27;m going to build my first house this summer and then go from there. Trying to make contacts too. Theres this upper class neighborhood a few miles away (like mine but a little more rural) and the developer is friends with my dad and I want to be friends with his son. That son&amp;#x27;s sister is best friends with the daughter of a billionaire family and she&amp;#x27;s single as far as I can tell by her instagram. So basically me building a house in that neighborhood puts me right on that billionaire girl&amp;#x27;s radar. I want to become an elite bros. But yeah anyway for now I&amp;#x27;m out slaving with the few guys who work for my dad. It&amp;#x27;s a cleaner trade than most. Could be worse. Can&amp;#x27;t wait to move on up in the world. 

***ADVICE*** for fellow zoomers reading this. Go into blue collar trades but go to college online and educate yourself either there or with independent study. I loathe the types who say &amp;quot;college is a scam&amp;quot; but then take pride in how uneducated they are. Be able to work with your hands and still know statistics, finance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854337:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854295
This zoomer is right. Learn a high yield trade (not all are) but don&amp;#x27;t br a retard and get at least SOME learning into you. Just read books and learn shit like normal. Maybe take a semester or two of basic college level bullshit for math, writing, reading, sciences/research, and anything relevant to your career and then leave it at that.

Im a nurse which is another good example of a traditional trade with endless demand, good pay, and lots of flexibility in terms of what you&amp;#x27;ll do and where you can work. After a year of wiping ass and watching people die in acute care you can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854575:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61851064
We already have poojeet construction workers. Construction has always been nigger work now it&amp;#x27;s poo&amp;#x27;d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854635:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854295
If your parents are upper class, why are working with your hands?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61854925:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854295
&amp;gt;Go into blue collar trades but go to college
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854337
&amp;gt;Learn a high yield trade (not all are
This is retarded bait. Do not go into trades. You will likely end up working for a contract company where there are no raises or even a 401k plan. College is the only way out of back breaking physical demanding labor that barely even pays well. Office cucks sit around making 80-130k in meetings all day. Far preferable of a life style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855527:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61854925
Money cannot buy class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855569:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855527
And poverty doesnt give it either. Id rather be comfy in a desk then slaving away in a hazardous work environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855595:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I own my house my car and have 5 acres, am I safely in the asset class?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855611:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855595
You tell us. Lmao. Do you need to work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855614:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My parents own ground leases so and I will inherit them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855617:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855614
Will you need to work though? Asset class doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855623:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850335
I have the same sympathy they had for workers who lost their jobs to automation and offshoring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855689:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855617
Nah, the ground lease requires zero responsibilities and they just collect the rental income&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855724:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855569
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855689
Yeah. Asset class. Dont need to work to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855755:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855611
No. I do work though because I like it. 

That said, I will share my wealth and home with all anons in need once the crisis hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855766:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850369
Own stocks, land , real estate etc&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850794
That FDR was a commie sumbitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855809:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850335
there are two classes, those who can own to live, and those who need to work to live. The &amp;quot;asset class&amp;quot; is too nonspecific to be meaningful.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850369
You gain entry by finding ways of taking ownership over the work of others. Small businesses, stocks, finance, etc. That or you&amp;#x27;re born into it.
You also can&amp;#x27;t just sit in the owning class, there&amp;#x27;s fierce competition and if you lose you could be kicked back into the working class.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850586
Shit take. The billionaires have profited like madmen because they outsource labor to cheap &amp;quot;brown&amp;quot; countries, and give jobs to exploitable &amp;quot;brown&amp;quot; people that cross the border trying to escape those cheap labor conditions. This is the defining mechanism for our economy, don&amp;#x27;t you forget it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855848:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850802
&amp;gt;millionaires in imaginary gains, not actual monetary value
KEK fucking retards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855849:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850335
Let&amp;#x27;s laugh at OP, who heard &amp;quot;asset class&amp;quot; for the first time and thought it was caste instead of investment classification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855904:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855809

The west took high tier immigrants first and each decade, the quality went down. We are now at the stage where there are no good immigrants to take in anymore. Therefore, ai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855908:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855809
&amp;gt; there are two classes, those who can own to live, and those who need to work to live. The &amp;quot;asset class&amp;quot; is too nonspecific to be meaningful.
Asset class is the class that owns to live. Those who work to live are called “working class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855911:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855809
Not a shit take, the quality of new immigrants are lower and lower. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855849
See&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855908&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855915:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850608
bosses need women employees, they know how to suck dick.

middle-aged or old white men are just fucked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855921:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855908
&amp;gt;Asset class is the class that owns to live
I&amp;#x27;m gonna do you a fav. Whoever taught you this isn&amp;#x27;t somebody that should be giving advice. Seek new mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855924:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61850335

Is that what they wanna build their data centers in space? You simply can&amp;#x27;t storm them. Winning!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855927:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855915
Posts like these bring down the quality of this place. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855921
Isn’t wrong. What is wrong about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855931:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855927
Asset class is like saying what category something is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855939:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855931
The asset owning class. Same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855944:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855939
Its not the same thing. Real estate is an asset class, precious metal is another asset class, shit even equities is an asset class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855950:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855944
Literally Bloomberg says the “asset class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855968:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855950
There is no financial context where asset class isn&amp;#x27;t used to mean classification of asset types. If &amp;quot;Bloomberg&amp;quot; says it, best case is it&amp;#x27;s some fucking affiliate writer with an agenda who writes articles for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855973:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855968
I meant on their television shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855979:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855968

I see a lot of companies and people doing it. I don&amp;#x27;t want to be the last one left. I don&amp;#x27;t want to invest in crypto since a lot of countries are starting to pass regulations for it. I don&amp;#x27;t want to invest in China. Where should i put my money in? Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856281:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856272
invest in europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856290:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Invest in Japanese industry. Particularly companies that produce equipment for the nuclear energy sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856297:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856281
&amp;gt;invest in europe
That&amp;#x27;s very broad. Got any specific leads? People have been trying to tell me to invest in defence stocks but everyone seems to be trying to bid for those right now and i am not a big enough player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856302:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856290
Good advise. Japan is going to try and make their own nukes so they will invest more into that sector. So i guess i&amp;#x27;ll do a split between Europe and Japan. Now i just need to find the right stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856305:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856272

Take this as base and add some individual EM countries that you want. Mexico, South East Asia, Turkey, Argentina...your choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856312:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856297
defence isn&amp;#x27;t a bad bet. if you&amp;#x27;re looking for single companies you should look for defence adjacent industrial businesses that are now adapting their production to defence, of which there are plenty. there is also a european defence ETF by wisdromtree, but you&amp;#x27;re buying mostly rheinmetall and saab with that one. 
honestly i think that you will already outperform the S&amp;amp;P500 with an MSCI Europe ETF for the next couple of years, especially if the USD falls further against the EUR, so i would just go with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856315:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856290
What is it about Japan that makes white people turn into annoying third world brownoids?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856319:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856272
&amp;gt;I don&amp;#x27;t want to invest in China
you doing it everyday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856325:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856312
&amp;gt;MSCI Europe ETF
I would buy msci eafe etf since it gives you japan exposure too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856335:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856302
Itochu, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are the best options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856338:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856315
It&amp;#x27;s the top tier pussy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856339:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856272
you also need to factor in exchange rates, you cannot really predict what markets are going to do the best, but what you can do is invest in the markets of countries with the weakest currencies compared to their history. That way you get to invest in markets at a discount and stack the numbers in your favor. 

Some good options: Japan, Australia, Mexico, Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856350:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all the good advice /biz/bros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856370:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856297
EXUS is a good start.
EU Defense and finance sector broke records last year, you would be chasing those profits now.
Something to keep eye on is infra imo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856537:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856297
Any etf that holds all those stocks with nearly equal weighting?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856335
Are those even available through Robinhood?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61856370
Is this an even spread of all the stocks in its holdings or is it like the SPY etf where 10 companies make up nearly 40% of its holdings value?&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1771143120013644s.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0" /></item><item><title>Is Ethereum worth buying at these levels? — 14 replies</title><link>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61855826</link><guid>https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/61855826</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 03:49:19 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is Ethereum worth buying at these levels?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replies: 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OP:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855830:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
You mean under $10k? It&amp;#x27;s a steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855835:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
it&amp;#x27;s a dead pos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855839:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
hope it goes to $0 it&amp;#x27;d be cathartic asf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855840:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855830
its down 50% since 2021 highs. what makes you think it will reach ath?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855841:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
No, proof of stake doomed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855893:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
I can&amp;#x27;t wait for this thing to finally die so crypto tech development can actually make meaningful progress again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855964:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
&amp;gt;these levels
the &amp;quot;no one sell for now&amp;quot; levels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855986:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No. Wait another year and buy my bags at $10k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61855995:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855826
No, crypto is going to be over for a long time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61856062:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;61855986
